    In the networked enterprise there is a need to support a shared work space or group where users of network partners can&#xD;
    collaborate with each other. These groups can be formal and informal on-demand groups / spaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Innovation Community of the NEFFICS Platform supports three kinds of groups, as well as access control and&#xD;
    categorization. The group kinds are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Standard group&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support forum&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Group linked to focus area&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></refinedDescription>

    As an exercise we chose to adapt the community to the process of Process innovation as described by Davenport. It is a&#xD;
    fairly generic process and will utilize several of the functions available in the Neffics Innovation Community. Some of&#xD;
    the steps of this model we will enable through the use of phases and gates in a customized innovation process, while we&#xD;
    adopt a scorecard for covering the detailing level of the model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here is a basic illustration of the Davenport process for process innovation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Steps 1 and 2 are about the comfort requirements for making process innovation happens. Identifying the processes of&#xD;
    choice, their value and relevance, as well as identifying the organizational and human resources and technologies one&#xD;
    wants to include in the process. It is recommended to create focus areas inside the Innovation Community for each of&#xD;
    the core business processes you want to innovate on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Steps 3 and 4 of the model put emphasis on understanding, and interpreting the core objectives of the process as well&#xD;
    as identifying different processing strategies. The Neffics Innovation community will meet this requirement by&#xD;
    registering challenges inside the work-group where the users can submit their strategies addressing the challenges as&#xD;
    ideas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Further it is necessary to implement the activities of step 5 as s phase/gate process inside the NEFFICS Innovation&#xD;
    Community.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>Focus areas are defined as one of many different ways of categorizing ideas and challenges. When supporting top-down or&#xD;
strategic innovation efforts, it is important to be able to track and report progress, and drive innovation for different&#xD;
strategic areas. These areas are registered as “focus areas” in the Innovation Community. Each “focus area” have its own&#xD;
area manager or responsible. Each focus area is directly reflected in the innovation pipeline for community where one can&#xD;
track inputs of innovation from germination and throughout their lifecycle.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Campaigns are an important way to stimulate and engage the innovation community stakeholders. The NEFFICS Innovation&#xD;
    Community will feature support for different campaign types, whereof some are already included in the current&#xD;
    implementation.&#xD;
