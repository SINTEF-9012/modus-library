  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), is designed to communicate a wide variety of information on business&#xD;
    processes to a wide variety of audiences, providing a standard notation that is readily understandable by all business&#xD;
    stakeholders. Business process descriptions bring real business vision and constitute an excellent formalization and&#xD;
    analysis tool when constructing systems. In the context of a development project they are used in business-oriented&#xD;
    activities related to requirements, specifications and analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business processes may be at a number of levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes down&#xD;
    to task flows which comprise a set of detailed specifications for the business services to be realized in the&#xD;
    service-oriented architecture. BPMN is designed to cover many types of modelling and allows the creation of end-to-end&#xD;
    business processes. It allows the specification of private processes (both non-executable and executable), public&#xD;
    processes, choreographies and collaborations.&#xD;
