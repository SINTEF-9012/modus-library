  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A service contract approach defines service specifications (the service contract) that define the roles each&#xD;
    participant plays in the service (such as provider and consumer) and the interfaces they implement to play that role in&#xD;
    that service. The service contract represents an agreement between the involved participants for how the service is to&#xD;
    be provided and consumed. This agreement includes the interfaces, choreography and any other terms and conditions.&#xD;
    Service contracts are frequently part of one or more services architectures that define how a set of participants&#xD;
    provide and use services for a particular business purpose or process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An important part of the service contract is the choreography. A choreography is a specification of what is transmitted&#xD;
    and when it is transmitted between participants to enact a service exchange. The choreography defines what happens&#xD;
    between the provider and consumer participants without defining their internal processes - their internal processes do&#xD;
    have to be compatible with their service contracts.&#xD;
