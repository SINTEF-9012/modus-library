  <mainDescription>The purpose of services architecture collaboration is to illustrate how kinds of entities work together for some purpose.&#xD;
Collaborations are based on the concepts of roles to define how entities are involved in that collaboration (how and why&#xD;
they collaborate) without depending on what kind of entity is involved (e.g. a person, organization or system). As such, we&#xD;
can say that an entity “plays a role” in a collaboration. The services architecture serves to define the requirements of&#xD;
each of the participants. The participant roles are filled by participants with service points required of the entities&#xD;
that fill these roles and are then bound by the services architectures in which they participate.</mainDescription>
  <purpose>The main purpose for the SoaML service diagram is to describe the operations and the interfaces for communicating with the&#xD;
service. In other words, the SoaML service diagram should provide all the information needed to interact with the service.</purpose>
