    Modelling in BPMN is made by simple diagrams with a small set of graphical elements. It should make it easy for&#xD;
    business users as well as developers to understand the flow and the process.&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&#xD;
    face=&quot;NimbusRomNo9L-Regu&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;NimbusRomNo9L-Regu&quot;>&amp;nbsp;Business processes may be at a number of&#xD;
    levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes down to task flows which comprise a set of&#xD;
    detailed specifications for the business services to be realized in the service-oriented architecture.&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Typically, BPMN is used to define business processes on the CIM level. The definitions are then mapped to more&#xD;
    technical models on the PIM and PSM level. Our practice&amp;nbsp;does not address the full scope of business modelling at&#xD;
    the CIM level, but rather assumes that some kind of business process models or descriptions already exist that have&#xD;
    been developed using existing BPMN guidelines. However, typically these models must be further refined and mapped to&#xD;
    SoaML concepts for describing the business perspective of an SOA.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    We propose to refine business processes in separate BPMN diagrams that are linked to SoaML concepts. Ideally, this&#xD;
    should be done in a modelling tool that allows to create integrated models using both BPMN and SoaML language&#xD;
    constructs. This ensures a tool-supported consistency between the modelling of the business processes, information and&#xD;
    organization as outlined here. In the case of using separate tools for modelling BMM, BPMN and SoaML, manual&#xD;
    consistency checks must be applied.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    consists of process, information and organization modelling steps.&lt;/font>&lt;/font>&#xD;
