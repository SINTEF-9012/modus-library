  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A participant is the type of a provider and/or consumer of services.&amp;nbsp; In the business domain a participant may be&#xD;
    a person, organization or system.&amp;nbsp; In the systems domain a participant may be a system, application or component.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Participant represents some (possibly concrete) party or component that provides and/or consumes services –&#xD;
    participants may represent people, organizations or systems that provide and/or use services. A Participant is a&#xD;
    service provider if it offers a service. A Participant is a service consumer if it uses a service – a participant may&#xD;
    provide or consume any number of services. Service consumer and provider are roles Participants play: the role of&#xD;
    providers in some services and consumers in others, depending on the capabilities they provide and the needs they have&#xD;
    to carry out their capabilities. Since most consumers and providers have both services and requests, Participant is&#xD;
    used to model both.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Participants have ports. These ports may use the «Service» and «Request» stereotypes which are the interaction points&#xD;
    where services are offered or consumed respectively. Internally a participant may specify a behavior, a business&#xD;
    process or a more granular service contract as a Participant Architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A concrete Participant may participate in and/or adhere to any number of services architectures. A composite structure&#xD;
    is generally used to define the concrete sub-components of the participant.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The full scope of a SOA is realized when the relationship between participants is described using a services&#xD;
    architecture. A services architecture shows how participants work together for a purpose, providing and using services.&#xD;
