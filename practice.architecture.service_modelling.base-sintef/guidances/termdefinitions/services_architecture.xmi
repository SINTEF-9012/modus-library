  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The high-level view of a Service Oriented Architecture that defines how a set of participants works together, forming a&#xD;
    community, for some purpose by providing and using services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A ServicesArchitecture (a SOA) describes how participants work together for a purpose by providing and using services&#xD;
    expressed as service contracts. By expressing the use of services, the ServicesArchitecture implies some degree of&#xD;
    knowledge of the dependencies between the participants in some context. Each use of a service in a ServicesArchitecture&#xD;
    is represented by the use of a ServiceContract bound to the roles of participants in that architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that use of a ServicesArchitecture is optional but is recommended to show a high level view of how a set of&#xD;
    Participants work together for some purpose. Where as simple services may not have any dependencies or links to a&#xD;
    business process, enterprise services can often only be understood in context. The services architecture provides that&#xD;
    context—and may also contain a behavior—which is the business process. The participant’s roles in a services&#xD;
    architecture correspond to the swim lanes or pools in a business process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A ServicesArchitecture may be specified externally – in a “B2B” type collaboration where there is no controlling entity&#xD;
    or as the ServicesArchitecture of a participant - under the control of a specific entity and/or business process. A&#xD;
    “B2B” services architecture uses the «ServicesArchitecture» stereotype on a collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Participant may play a role in any number of services architecture thereby representing the role a participant plays&#xD;
    and the requirements that each role places on the participant.&lt;br />&#xD;
