  <mainDescription>A part of a Message that is attached to rather than contained in the message. An Attachment denotes some component of a&#xD;
messages which is an attachment to it (as opposed to a direct part of the message itself). In general this is not likely to&#xD;
be used greatly in higher level design activities, but for many processes attached data is important to differentiate from&#xD;
embedded message data. For example, a catalog service may return general product details as a part of the structured&#xD;
message but images as attachments to the message; this also allows us to denote that the encoding of the images is binary&#xD;
(as opposed to the textual encoding of the main message). Attachments may be used to indicate part of service data that can&#xD;
be separately accessed, reducing the data sent between consumers and providers unless it is needed.</mainDescription>
