  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Milestone is a means for depicting progress in behaviors in order to analyze liveness. Milestones are particularly&#xD;
    useful for behaviors that are long lasting or even infinite.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Milestone depicts progress by defining a signal that is sent to an abstract observer. The signal contains an integer&#xD;
    value that intuitively represents the amount of progress that has been achieved when passing a point attached to this&#xD;
    Milestone.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Provided that a SoaML specification is available it is possible to analyze a service behavior (a Participant or a&#xD;
    ServiceContract) to determine properties of the progress value. Such analysis results could be e.g. that the progress&#xD;
    value can never go beyond a certain value. This could then be interpreted as a measure of the potential worth of the&#xD;
    analyzed behaviors. In situations where alternative service behaviors are considered as in Agent negotiations, such a&#xD;
    progress measurement could be a useful criterion for the choice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Milestones can also be applied imperatively as specification of tracing information in a debugging or monitoring&#xD;
    situation. The signal sent when the Milestone is encountered may contain arguments that can register any current&#xD;
    values.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Progress values may be interpreted ordinally in the sense that a progress value of 4 is higher than a progress value of&#xD;
    3. A reasonable interpretation would be that the higher the possible progress value, the better. Alternatively the&#xD;
    progress values may be interpreted nominally as they may represent distinct reachable situations. In such a case the&#xD;
    analysis would have to consider sets of reachable values. It would typically be a reasonable interpretation that&#xD;
    reaching a superset of values would constitute better progress possibilities.&#xD;
