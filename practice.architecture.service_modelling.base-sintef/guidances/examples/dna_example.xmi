    Dealer Network Architecture (DNA)&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This example is taken from the paper [Elvesæter, et al. 2011]&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;adopts the Dealer Network&#xD;
    Architecture example from the SoaML specification. The example in the specification is somewhat difficult to read&#xD;
    because of the different approaches to service specifications. On closer inspection of the example in the SoaML&#xD;
    specification, we found out that there were in fact two different variants of the example; one favouring the service&#xD;
    contract based approach and the other favouring the service interface based approach. These two variants are slightly&#xD;
    different and have been modelled using two different modelling tools, thus the reader is faced with a somewhat unclear&#xD;
    and inconsistent running example throughout the specification. A full example favouring the service contract based&#xD;
    approached is documented in [Casanave 2009]&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> and a full example favouring the service interface based&#xD;
    approach is documented in [Amsden 2010]&lt;sup>3&lt;/sup>. Both of these authors were heavily involved in the SoaML&#xD;
    specification process. Furthermore, we also found out that some UML tools do not properly support UML collaboration,&#xD;
    resulting in poor support for the SoaML service contract based approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this example&amp;nbsp;we merged and unified the two different variants of the example used in the specification and&#xD;
    modelled the example using the Modelio modelling tool (www.modeliosoft.com) that equally supports both the service&#xD;
    contract and service interface based approaches of SoaML. The example was also extended to show a full integration and&#xD;
    benefits of multi-party and compound service contracts in specifying services architectures. Figure&amp;nbsp;1 shows the&#xD;
    services architecture for the unified example.&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Figure 1:&lt;/strong> Services architecture for the Dealer Network Architecture illustrative example with four&#xD;
    participants and the roles they play in the three service contract specifications&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Dealer Network Architecture consists of four participants (dealer, manufacturer, agent and shipper) interacting and&#xD;
    fulfilling their roles defined in the three service contracts: Secure Purchase (specifying the roles buyer, seller and&#xD;
    broker), Shipping Request (specifying the roles sender and shipper) and Shipping Status (specifying the roles receiver&#xD;
    and shipper). In the services architecture the participants are bounded to the roles defined in the service contracts&#xD;
    through the collaboration uses purchase (instance of Secure Purchase), ship (instance of Shipping Request) and status&#xD;
    (instance of the Ship Status). Details of these service contracts will be described in the subsequent sections.&#xD;
