  <mainDescription>A platform independent model is a view of a system from the platform independent viewpoint. A PIM exhibits a specified&#xD;
degree of platform independence so as to be suitable for use with a number of different platforms of similar type. A very&#xD;
common technique for achieving platform independence is to target a system model for a technology-neutral virtual machine.&#xD;
A virtual machine is defined as a set of parts and services (communications, scheduling, naming, etc.), which are defined&#xD;
independently of any specific platform and which are realized in platform-specific&lt;br />&#xD;
ways on different platforms. A virtual machine is a platform, and such a model is specific to that platform. But that model&#xD;
is platform independent with respect to the class of different platforms on which that virtual machine has been&#xD;
implemented. This is because such models are unaffected by the underlying platform and, hence, fully conform to the&#xD;
criterion of platform independence defined in section 2.2.10.2.</mainDescription>
