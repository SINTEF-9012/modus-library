  <mainDescription>This task should be performed for each&amp;nbsp;Goal description. The aim of this activity is for the Semantic Web Service&#xD;
engineer to reduce the Capability Design, Non Functional Design, and Choreography Design down into concrete implementations&#xD;
in order to produce a Goal description, extending and refining the WSMO model that was previously created.</mainDescription>

    The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to create a concrete capability description, extending and refining the previously created&#xD;
    WSMO model. In this&amp;nbsp;step the Semantic Web Service engineer must create a capability description,&amp;nbsp;as part of&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;goal description, with preconditions, postconditions, assumptions, and effects. The main job of the engineer&#xD;
    is to transform the textual description of these conditions&amp;nbsp;into logical descriptions according to the logical&#xD;
    formalism mandated by the targeted discovery broker service.&#xD;

    The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to create a concrete non-functional preference description. In this&amp;nbsp;step the Semantic&#xD;
    Web Service engineer must annotate the&amp;nbsp;goal description with the non-functional preferences. The main job of the&#xD;
    engineer is to model each of the non-functional preferences,&amp;nbsp;their associated values, and their weights&amp;nbsp;using&#xD;
    the ontologies&amp;nbsp;that were selected for modeling the non-functional aspects of the service.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to create a concrete choreography, extending and refining the previously created WSMO&#xD;
    model. In this task the Semantic Web Service engineer must create a choreography description, as part of the&amp;nbsp;goal&#xD;
    description, with a state signature and transition rules. The main job of the engineer is to convert the dependancy&#xD;
    diagram into Abstract State Machine (ASM) transition rules according to the logical formalism mandated by the targeted&#xD;
    chorography broker service. The engineer must also create the state signature of the choreography by encoding the&#xD;
    variables that are input to or output from the choreography, as per the dependancy diagram. Addition variables may be&#xD;
    specified as static, controlled, or shared in the choreography as needed.&#xD;
