  <mainDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;task is to define the overview architecture of all the Web Service and Goal descriptions needed to&#xD;
realise the requirements, along with the ontologies that they use. The high-level architecture also contains the mediators&#xD;
that link Web Service, Goal and Ontology descriptions together.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to identify the concrete Web services that are mentioned in the requirements phase and to add&#xD;
them to the high-level architecture. In this step, the architect should add the concrete Web services, refered to in the&#xD;
Requirements Specification to the high-level picture of the architecture.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to identify the Semantic Web Service descriptions that are part of the high level&#xD;
architecture. The Requirements Specification identifies functional, non functional, and behavioural aspects of services&#xD;
that need to be described. For example, if a particular Web service needs two advertisements, each with their own non&#xD;
functional description&lt;br />&#xD;
and choreography, which need to be advertised on two broker services that use different formalisms, then the architect&#xD;
should identify four Semantic Web Service descriptions. It should be noted that in complex scenarios the number of service&#xD;
descriptions can get quite large, especially if many functional and behavioural advertisements need to be made on many&#xD;
different types of broker services.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this step is to identify the Goal descriptions that are part of the high level architecture.&#xD;
The&amp;nbsp;Requirements Specification refer to a number of Goal descriptions that must be included in the high level&#xD;
architecture. The architect should build a list of Goals, where existing Goals are identified by their identifiers and new&#xD;
Goals, which must be created in the&amp;nbsp;PSM modelling (implementation)&amp;nbsp;phase.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to identify the ontologies needed in the high level archiecture. This&amp;nbsp;step utilizes the&#xD;
requirements from the Requirements Specification to identify the ontologies that are needed to build the Web Service and&#xD;
Goal descriptions within the high level architecture and those related ontologies with which these ontologies should be&#xD;
interoperable. The architect should build a list of ontologies; in this list, the architect should also specify which Web&#xD;
Service and Goal descriptions use each of the ontologies, and the logical formalism that the ontology should be written in.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to identify the mediators between the different Web Services, Goals and Ontologies present in&#xD;
the high level architecture. A number of different types of mediators are required in the high level architecture. Ontology&#xD;
to Ontology mediators are required between ontologies that need to interoperate with one another.&amp;nbsp;Web Service to Web&#xD;
Service mediators and Goal to Goal mediators are needed where some relationship between two Web Service or two Goal&#xD;
descriptions needs to be specified.&amp;nbsp;Finally, wgMediators are needed in cases where mediation based discovery broker&#xD;
servcies are used, in order to connect Web&amp;nbsp; Service descriptions with the Goals that they resolve. The architect&#xD;
should identify these&amp;nbsp;mediators by looking at the Requirements Specification.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to identify the mapping documents that are required to enable the ooMediators in the high&#xD;
level architecture. If mapping documents are to used to realize ooMediators within the system, then the architect should&#xD;
identify and name the mapping documents that are required in order to realize those ooMediators previously identified. If&#xD;
bidirectional mappings are required then two mapping documents, one for each direction, should be added to the&#xD;
architecture.</sectionDescription>
