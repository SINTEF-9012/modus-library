    If service advertisement is identified as a needed feature, then the requirements analyst should gain an understanding&#xD;
    of the functionality of the service to be described or the functional aspects of the service to be found. Furthermore,&#xD;
    requirements should be gathered related to the exact functional aspects of the Semantic Web Service artifacts to be&#xD;
    created, for example which specific functionality of the Web service will be advertised. This step&#xD;
    includes:&amp;nbsp;understanding the functionality of relevant services,&amp;nbsp;identifying&amp;nbsp;what service functionality&#xD;
    should be advertised,&amp;nbsp;identifying where the service advertisements should be advertised,&amp;nbsp;identifying examples&#xD;
    of user Goals that should find each advertisement,&amp;nbsp;understanding the functionality of the system that will issue a&#xD;
    Goal.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>If service ranking is identified&amp;nbsp;as a needed feature,&amp;nbsp;then the requirements analyst should gather requirements&#xD;
related to the non functional aspects of the Semantic Web Service artifacts or the Goal to be created. For example, the non&#xD;
functional behaviour that will be advertised for a particular Web service or the non functional preferences that should be&#xD;
applied in order to rank services return from service discovery. This step includes understanding the non functional&#xD;
behaviour of the service and identifying non-functional properties to be advertised.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>If automatic invocation is identified&amp;nbsp;as a needed feature,&amp;nbsp;then the requirements analyst should gather&#xD;
requirements related to the behavioural aspects of the Semantic Web Service or the Goal to be created, i.e. the external&#xD;
interface of Web services that will be described or the way in which the requester wishes to interact with the service.&#xD;
This step includes: understanding the behaviour of each of the operations on the service, understanding the relationship&#xD;
between the operations on the service, identifying useful groupings of service operations, identifying which groupings of&#xD;
service operations should be advertised.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Using the functional, non functional, and behavioural requirements as input, the requirements analyst can begin the process&#xD;
of requirements gathering for the ontologies that will be required to describe the functional, non functional, and&#xD;
behavioural aspects of the Semantic Web Service or Goal to be created. This&amp;nbsp;involves the selection of an appropriate&#xD;
ontology engineering methodology and performing the activities from this methodology. Thus, this step includes: identifying&#xD;
what needs to be modeled, selecting an appropriate ontology engineering methodology, erforming the activities related to&#xD;
requirements gathering in the selected methodology, identifying models that potential collaborators use.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to analyse the requirements gathered throughout the previous steps to check for consistency&#xD;
and to see if they meet the original&amp;nbsp;Business Requirements Specification. This&amp;nbsp;also includes the identification&#xD;
of dependancies between the different requirements and the assignment of priorities to the different requirements. Thus,&#xD;
this step inludes: deciding if requirements meet the problem to be addressed, identifying dependancies between gathered&#xD;
requirements, prioritising requirements.</sectionDescription>
