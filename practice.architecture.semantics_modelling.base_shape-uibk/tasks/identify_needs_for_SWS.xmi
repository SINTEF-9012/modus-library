    <sectionDescription>The success of a Semantic Web Service deployment hinges on their correct application. Utilizing the wrong technology to&#xD;
solve a particular problem will rarely result in success. It is recommended that the requirement analyst builds a short&#xD;
list of those features of the problem statement that motivate the use of Semantic Web Services, e.g. Automatic discovery of&#xD;
services based on a description of their function. In some cases the justification for Semantic Web Services may be&#xD;
trivial, i.e. where the problem statement is to Provide availability of the providers services via a Semantic Execution&#xD;
Environment.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The requirements analyst should identify which specific Semantic Web Service scenarios are necessary to fulfill the&#xD;
stakeholders problem, and which role the stakeholder is playing in each of these scenarios. For example: are service&#xD;
advertisements needed? is automatic invocation needed? is the stakeholder playing the role of service provider or service&#xD;
requester?</sectionDescription>
