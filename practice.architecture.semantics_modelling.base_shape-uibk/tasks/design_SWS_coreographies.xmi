    <sectionDescription>The aim of this&amp;nbsp;step is to build a dependancy diagram for the different operations, inputs, and outputs of the&#xD;
service. Utilizing the requriements gathered in the Requirements Specification, the designer should create a dependancy&#xD;
diagram for each of the choreographies identified in the high level architecture. For Web Service choreographies, the&#xD;
dependancy diagram should capture the different operations on the service, their inputs, their outputs, and the&#xD;
depenendancies that exist with other operations. Similarly for Goal choreographies, the dependancy diagram should capture&#xD;
the expected operations on services, the inputs the requester is willing to send to them, the outputs the requester is&#xD;
expecting to recieve from them, and any needed dependancies between the operations expected on the service. If the ontology&#xD;
design activities have been conducted then the designer should utilize concepts from the ontologies when building the&#xD;
dependancy diagram.</sectionDescription>
