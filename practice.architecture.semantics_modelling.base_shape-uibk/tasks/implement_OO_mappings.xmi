    <sectionDescription>Two approaches can be defined to implementing the mappings. A bottom-up approach to creating mappings means that the&#xD;
engineer starts by creating mappings from the most primitive ontological concepts in the source and target ontologies, and&#xD;
then builds upon these mappings to create more complex mappings between more complex ontological concepts. Using this&#xD;
approach allows the mappings between primitive ontological concepts to act as a minimal agreed upon set of mappings between&#xD;
the source and target ontologies, making the creation of more complex mappings much easier. Intuitively a top-down approach&#xD;
to creating mappings happens from the opposite end as the bottom-up approach with the&amp;nbsp;engineer creating mappings for&#xD;
the more complex ontological concepts first and then addressing less complex ontological concepts as they are reached&#xD;
through the mapping process. This approach is much more useful when the identified breadth of mappings required is much&#xD;
smaller than the breadth of the source ontologies. In such a scenario using a bottom-up approach, the engineer would risk&#xD;
creating unnecessary mappings between primitive ontological concepts.</sectionDescription>
