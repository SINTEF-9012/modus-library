  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An ontology is a knowledge representation format that define the terminology and background knowledge of a domain. They&#xD;
    have been identiﬁed as the base technology for the Semantic Web, the grand vision for the further evolution of the&#xD;
    World Wide Web.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Adopting the denotation from the philosophical study of being and existence, an ontology is deﬁned as a ”formal,&#xD;
    explicit speciﬁcation of a shared conceptualization”.&amp;nbsp; This means that an ontology deﬁnes a conceptual model of a&#xD;
    domain that ideally represents an agreed consensus among involved parties. The conceptual model is deﬁned in terms of&#xD;
    concepts that denote the entities in the domain of discourse. These are characterized by properties, and relations&#xD;
    describe associations between concepts whereby subsump-&lt;br />&#xD;
    tion and membership relations deﬁne the taxonomic backbone of the ontology. Additional domain knowledge can be speciﬁed&#xD;
    in terms of axioms. Individuals in the domain are rep-&lt;br />&#xD;
    resented as instances of a concept.&amp;nbsp; The conceptual model is then represented in a formal, machine-processable&#xD;
    language upon which reasoning techniques can be applied for advanced information processing. The major merit is that&#xD;
    ontologies can bridge the gap between the real world and IT systems , and that heterogeneous data can be integrated on&#xD;
    the semantic level by deﬁning mappings between ontologies.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>Ontologies describe the terminology and background knowledge of a domain in a formal language, providing the basis from&#xD;
sematically enabled information processing. This this typically used to descrbibe the information model for a&#xD;
service-engineering project on the CIM level.</purpose>
  <notation>several ontology spefification languages have been defined for the Semantic Web: RDF, OWL, WSML, etc.&amp;nbsp;</notation>
