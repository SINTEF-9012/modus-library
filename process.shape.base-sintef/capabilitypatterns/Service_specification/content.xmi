    &lt;span style=&quot;mso-ansi-language: EN-US&quot;>Furthermore, service specification is intended to allow potential consumers and&#xD;
    integrators to exploit the processes developed to support service centric system development. The service specification&#xD;
    is written and published by the service provider; the provider is therefore responsible for providing the&#xD;
    specifications necessary for consumers to utilize service centric system engineering processes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The service-centric system engineering activities that depend upon service specifications (e.g. service discovery,&#xD;
    monitoring, etc.) each have different requirements for what service properties are specified and how they are&#xD;
    specified. To address these different requirements, we structure a service specification as a set of partial&#xD;
    specifications call facets. Facets are abstractions over service properties, with each designed to meet the&#xD;
    requirements of a particular process activity.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose is to specify services in a manner that makes their suitability for use in a particular context assessable&#xD;
    by potential consumers.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
