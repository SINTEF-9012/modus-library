  <mainDescription>&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    A BPMN model defines the business processes of the domain which are relevant to the service-oriented architecture, and&#xD;
    which will enable the goals to be met, and the roles of the resources that perform those processes. It includes a full&#xD;
    definition of the roles in the business, focusing on those fulfilled by the system or component to be developed.&#xD;
    Business process descriptions bring real business vision and constitute an excellent formalization and analysis tool&#xD;
    when constructing systems. In the context of a development project they are used in business-oriented activities&#xD;
    related to requirements, specifications and analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Business processes may be at a number of levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes down&#xD;
    to task flows which is a set of detailed specifications for the business services that the service-oriented&#xD;
    architecture will provide. BPMN is designed to cover many types of modelling and allows the creation of end-to-end&#xD;
    business processes. It allows the specification of private processes (both non-executable and executable), public&#xD;
    processes, choreographies and collaborations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together. This&#xD;
    model&amp;nbsp;formalizes the business process and&amp;nbsp;defines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the business processes of the domain which are relevant to the Product, and which will enable the goals to be met,&#xD;
        and:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the roles of the resources that perform those processes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;model may be at a number of levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes&#xD;
    down to the WARM, which is a set of detailed specifications for the business services that each IT element in the&#xD;
    Product will provide. It includes a full definition of the roles in the business, focusing on those fulfilled by the&#xD;
    system or component to be developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Business Process and Roles model is generally prepared at the same time as the associated Business Resource&#xD;
        model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To build a Business Process model the Business Modelling Conceptual Model (or metamodel) is used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business process is defined in terms of its steps, and each step performed by a resource at a higher level of&#xD;
    detail may then be treated as a process performed by a community (of resources) and further analysed at a lower level&#xD;
    of detail. Eventually, using the WARM concepts of Human Step, Tool Step and Immediate Step, &quot;leaf&quot; steps will be&#xD;
    defined, and assigned to specific elements of the Product to be developed. The time to stop analysing is when, by&#xD;
    analysing the processes, the Product's role in them is defined, and when there are no more questions about the business&#xD;
    to be answered.&#xD;
