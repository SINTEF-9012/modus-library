    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together to deliver a tangible&#xD;
    result and bring added business value to the company. A business process model generally describes the business and not&#xD;
    the IT system. A business process is transversal, and is generally based on several structures and applications of one&#xD;
    or several organizations. Business process descriptions bring real business vision&amp;nbsp;and constitute an excellent&#xD;
    formalization and analysis tool when constructing systems. In the context of a development project&amp;nbsp;they&#xD;
    are&amp;nbsp;used in business-oriented activities related to requirements, specifications and analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business process model is derived through a set of activities that encompass brain-storming sessions, structured&#xD;
    workshops, interviews and feed-back sessions, and detailed modelling using a BPMN2 modelling tool.&#xD;

    A BPMN model defines the business processes of the domain which are relevant to the service-oriented architecture, and&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Business processes may be at a number of levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes down&#xD;
    to task flows which is a set of detailed specifications for the business services that the service-oriented&#xD;
    architecture will provide. BPMN is designed to cover many types of modelling and allows the creation of end-to-end&#xD;
    business processes. It allows the specification of private processes (both non-executable and executable), public&#xD;
    processes, choreographies and collaborations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together. This&#xD;
    model&amp;nbsp;formalizes the business process and&amp;nbsp;defines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the business processes of the domain which are relevant to the Product, and which will enable the goals to be met,&#xD;
        and:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the roles of the resources that perform those processes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;model may be at a number of levels of detail, from a high level description of the business processes&#xD;
    down to the WARM, which is a set of detailed specifications for the business services that each IT element in the&#xD;
    Product will provide. It includes a full definition of the roles in the business, focusing on those fulfilled by the&#xD;
    system or component to be developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Business Process and Roles model is generally prepared at the same time as the associated Business Resource&#xD;
        model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To build a Business Process model the Business Modelling Conceptual Model (or metamodel) is used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business process is defined in terms of its steps, and each step performed by a resource at a higher level of&#xD;
    detail may then be treated as a process performed by a community (of resources) and further analysed at a lower level&#xD;
    of detail. Eventually, using the WARM concepts of Human Step, Tool Step and Immediate Step, &quot;leaf&quot; steps will be&#xD;
    defined, and assigned to specific elements of the Product to be developed. The time to stop analysing is when, by&#xD;
    analysing the processes, the Product's role in them is defined, and when there are no more questions about the business&#xD;
    to be answered.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Business Resource Model is generally prepared at the same time as the associated Business Process &amp;amp; Roles&#xD;
        model, and methods and techniques used are similar, i.e. activities that include brain-storming sessions,&#xD;
        structured workshops, interviews and feed-back sessions, and detailed modelling using a UML tool.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Resources that are of concern to the business will mostly, but not entirely, be discovered from consideration&#xD;
        of the things that have to happen in the business (as contained in the Business Process Model). All resources&#xD;
        either make those things happen, or are involved in those things that happen, in that, what happens, happens to&#xD;
        them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In addition, reference should be made to, and consistency maintained with, the Context Statement, since that is a&#xD;
        representation at a high level of all the main things of interest to the Product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The set of business concepts are then refined into a class model, at the level of detail being considered which&#xD;
        defines the interesting attributes of and relationships between all the resources (both actors and artefacts)&#xD;
        identified in the Business Process Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The conceptual model used is the same as for the Business Process model, namely the Business Modelling Conceptual&#xD;
        Model, with additional freedom to add any relevant associations, attributes and state machines, as provided by&#xD;
        standard UML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Packaging of this class model is a modelling choice, but dependencies can be reduced by confining resources to the&#xD;
        communities with which they are involved. Thus, each «Community» package would contain two packages, one with the&#xD;
        relevant Business Process Model, the other with the relevant Business Resource Model.&lt;br />&#xD;

    The Business information model&amp;nbsp;identifies and defines the main things (and concepts) of the domain that are&#xD;

    itself), and those things that have things done to or with them, and details the relationships between these concepts.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Product comprises a complete and consistent set of models for the Product, namely Business Model, Requirements Model,&#xD;
    Architecture Model and one or more Platform Specific Model together with the corresponding Executables.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Resource Model takes the form of a UML class model as part of the PIM for the Product (see the example&#xD;
    model structure). In cases where it is useful it may be accompanied by state machine models for any of the resources&#xD;
    modelled.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A service contract approach defines service specifications (the service contract) that define the roles each&#xD;
    participant plays in the service (such as provider and consumer) and the interfaces they implement to play that role in&#xD;
    that service. The service contract represents an agreement between the involved participants for how the service is to&#xD;
    be provided and consumed. This agreement includes the interfaces, choreography and any other terms and conditions.&#xD;
    Service contracts are frequently part of one or more services architectures that define how a set of participants&#xD;
    provide and use services for a particular business purpose or process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An important part of the service contract is the choreography. A choreography is a specification of what is transmitted&#xD;
    and when it is transmitted between participants to enact a service exchange. The choreography defines what happens&#xD;
    between the provider and consumer participants without defining their internal processes - their internal processes do&#xD;
    have to be compatible with their service contracts.&#xD;

    A services architecture is a high level description of how participants work together for a purpose by providing and&#xD;

    participants and service realizations that fulfill specific roles. A role defines the basic function (or set of&#xD;
    functions) that an entity may perform in a particular context. In contrast, a participant specifies the type of a party&#xD;
    that fills the role in the context of a specific services architecture. Both service contracts and participants can be&#xD;
    reused when composing different services in other services architectures.&#xD;
