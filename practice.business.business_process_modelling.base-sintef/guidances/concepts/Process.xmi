  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Process describes a flow of activities in an organisation, and is specified as a workflow. Three main categories are&#xD;
    used to define a process: flow objects, artefacts and connecting objects. Flow objects describe the workflow of the&#xD;
    process, and are of three types: Activities (i.e. the kind of work to be done), Events (start, end and intermediate&#xD;
    events) and Gateways (i.e. forking and merging of paths in the workflow). Artefacts allow the specification of data and&#xD;
    annotations. Finally, connecting objects allow connecting the previous objects together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An &lt;strong>Activity&lt;/strong> is work that is performed within a Business Process. An Activity can be atomic or&#xD;
        non-atomic (compound). The types of Activities that are a part of a Process are: Task, Sub-Process, and Call&#xD;
        Activity, which allows the inclusion of re-usable Tasks and Processes in the diagram. However, a Process is not a&#xD;
        specific graphical object. Instead, it is a set of graphical objects. The following sections will focus on the&#xD;
        graphical objects Sub-Process and Task. Activities represent points in a Process flow where work is performed. They&#xD;
        are the executable elements of a BPMN Process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An &lt;strong>Event&lt;/strong> is something that “happens” during the course of a Process. These Events affect the flow&#xD;
        of the Process and usually have a cause or an impact and in general require or allow for a reaction. The term&#xD;
        “event” is general enough to cover many things in a Process. The start of an Activity, the end of an Activity, the&#xD;
        change of state of a document, a Message that arrives, etc., all could be considered Events.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Gateways&lt;/strong> are used to control how Sequence Flows interact as they converge and diverge within a&#xD;
        Process. If the flow does not need to be controlled, then a Gateway is not needed. The term “Gateway” implies that&#xD;
        there is a gating mechanism that either allows or disallows passage through the Gateway--that is, as Tokens arrive&#xD;
        at a Gateway, they can be merged together on input and/or split apart on output as the Gateway mechanisms are&#xD;
        invoked.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three types of connections: sequence flow (i.e. ordering of flow objects), message flow (message exchanged&#xD;
    between organisations), and associations (which link Artefacts with Flow objects). Message flows are used only in BPMN&#xD;
    collaborations (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.business.business_process_modelling.base-sintef/guidances/concepts/collaboration_F4936882.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_25EZMDv1Ed-OFL4K-b4X_A&quot;>Collaboration&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 1 shows a simple process, with a sequence of activities. Note that activities can have different types: in the&#xD;
    figure we can see human, automated and send-message activities.&#xD;

    Types of BPMN processes&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Process modeling is used to communicate a wide variety of information to a wide variety of audiences. BPMN is&#xD;
    designed to cover many types of modeling and allows the creation of end-to-end Business Processes. There are three&#xD;
    basic types of BPMN Processes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Private Non-executable (internal) Business Processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Private Executable (internal) Business Processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Public Processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Private (Internal) Business Processes&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Private Business Processes are those internal to a specific organization. These Processes have been generally called&#xD;
    workflow or BPM Processes. Another synonym typically used in the Web services area is the Orchestration of services.&#xD;
    There are two (2) types of private Processes: executable and non-executable. An executable Process is a Process that&#xD;
    has been modeled for the purpose of being executed. Of course, during the development cycle of the Process, there will&#xD;
    be stages where the Process does not have enough detail to be “executable.” A non-executable Process is a private&#xD;
    Process that has been modeled for the purpose of documenting Process behavior at a modeler-defined level of detail.&#xD;
    Thus, information required for execution, such as formal condition expressions are typically not included in a&#xD;
    non-executable Process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a swimlanes-like notation is used (e.g., a Collaboration, see below) then a private Business Process will be&#xD;
    contained within a single Pool. The Process flow is therefore contained within the Pool and cannot cross the boundaries&#xD;
    of the Pool. The flow of Messages can cross the Pool boundary to show the interactions that exist between separate&#xD;
    private Business Processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Public Processes&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A public Process represents the interactions between a private Business Process and another Process or Participant.&#xD;
    Only those Activities that are used to communicate to the other Participant(s), plus the order of these Activities, are&#xD;
    included in the public Process. All other “internal” Activities of the private Business Process are not shown in the&#xD;
    public Process. Thus, the public Process shows to the outside world the Messages, and the order of these Messages, that&#xD;
    are required to interact with that Business Process. Public Processes can be modeled separately or within a&#xD;
    Collaboration to show the flow of Messages between the public Process Activities and other Participants. Note that the&#xD;
    public type of Process was named “abstract” in BPMN 1.2.&#xD;
