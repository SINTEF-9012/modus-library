    Methods and techniques:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Business Resource Model is generally prepared at the same time as the associated Business Process &amp;amp; Roles&#xD;
        model, and methods and techniques used are similar, i.e. activities that include brain-storming sessions,&#xD;
        structured workshops, interviews and feed-back sessions, and detailed modelling using a UML tool.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Resources that are of concern to the business will mostly, but not entirely, be discovered from consideration&#xD;
        of the things that have to happen in the business (as contained in the Business Process Model). All resources&#xD;
        either make those things happen, or are involved in those things that happen, in that, what happens, happens to&#xD;
        them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In addition, reference should be made to, and consistency maintained with, the Context Statement, since that is a&#xD;
        representation at a high level of all the main things of interest to the Product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The set of business concepts are then refined into a class model, at the level of detail being considered which&#xD;
        defines the interesting attributes of and relationships between all the resources (both actors and artefacts)&#xD;
        identified in the Business Process Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The conceptual model used is the same as for the Business Process model, namely the Business Modelling Conceptual&#xD;
        Model, with additional freedom to add any relevant associations, attributes and state machines, as provided by&#xD;
        standard UML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Packaging of this class model is a modelling choice, but dependencies can be reduced by confining resources to the&#xD;
        communities with which they are involved. Thus, each «Community» package would contain two packages, one with the&#xD;
        relevant Business Process Model, the other with the relevant Business Resource Model.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Create a UML class diagram. This diagram will be used for describing&amp;nbsp;the details of a&amp;nbsp;business process. If the&#xD;
