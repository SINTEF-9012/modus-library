  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together to deliver a tangible&#xD;
    result and bring added business value to the company. A business process model generally describes the business and not&#xD;
    the IT system. A business process is transversal, and is generally based on several structures and applications of one&#xD;
    or several organizations. Business process descriptions bring real business vision&amp;nbsp;and constitute an excellent&#xD;
    formalization and analysis tool when constructing systems. In the context of a development project&amp;nbsp;they&#xD;
    are&amp;nbsp;used in business-oriented activities related to requirements, specifications and analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business process model is derived through a set of activities that encompass brain-storming sessions, structured&#xD;
    workshops, interviews and feed-back sessions, and detailed modelling using a BPMN2 modelling tool.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Process Model is derived directly from the Goal Model. Goals may be thought of as high level statements of&#xD;
    the things that have to happen in a business, each expressed as an outcome, but in a way that leaves unspecified how&#xD;
    that outcome is to be made to occur. As goal analysis proceeds, the analyst becomes aware that he or she is&#xD;
    increasingly describing not so much a desired outcome as the means by which a higher level outcome is to be achieved,&#xD;
    namely an enabling behaviour. The distinction between goal and behaviour to achieve a goal is inevitably blurred and to&#xD;
    some extent subjective. The key thing to remember is that, whereas a goal is some desired state of affairs, a behaviour&#xD;
    is a specification for something that happens, the end result of which is the desired state of affairs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Thus, the first step in creating the Business Process Model will be the identification of the enabling behaviours that&#xD;
    have to happen for each goal to be achieved. Initially this is done through a brain-storming process and production of&#xD;
    an unstructured list of enabling behaviours for each goal. This list is then consolidated into a single set of enabling&#xD;
    behaviours that, together, support all goals. This is the starting point for the Business Process Model which may then&#xD;
    be entered into the tool using the Business Process Modelling Profile.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each Enabling Behaviour is entered into the package containing the business processes in the top level Community model&#xD;
    as a Class stereotyped either as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Business Process&amp;gt;&amp;gt;, where it can clearly be seen that this behaviour can&#xD;
    be represented as a set of steps with a defined beginning and end, or, where no such approach is apparent, as a&#xD;
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Behavioural Policy&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. The distinction between the two kinds of Enabling Behaviour may be subjective. The&#xD;
    key point is that Business Processes should be capable of being expressed as a set of structured steps, each performed&#xD;
    by some actor (resource) representing a concrete person, a machine (e.g. an IT system) or a collection of people and/&#xD;
    or machines.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_KlyN4Ob8Ed-nztBGQnvNAA" name="6. Detailing of business processes." guid="_KlyN4Ob8Ed-nztBGQnvNAA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business process that involves the Product in any way has to be detailed to the extent that, when the model is&#xD;
    complete, the Product's role in that business process is fully understood and specified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general (but not exclusively), the reason for detailing a process is because the actor-resource that performs that&#xD;
    process is a composite that includes the Product being modelled together with some other resources, not part of this&#xD;
    development, such as a user or an interfacing system or component. Thus, it is necessary to detail both the process&#xD;
    itself and the structure of actor resource that performs that process, and the method for detailing processes is one in&#xD;
    which both concepts are decomposed in parallel. In short,&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the process being detailed (which may be some step in a higher level process), a thing that has to happen, is&#xD;
        considered as consisting of a set of steps, and:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the thing that performs that higher level step, an actor resource, is considered, at a more detailed level, as a&#xD;
        community of resources each fulfilling a role, each role being responsible for one or more of the steps in the&#xD;
        detailed process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that the &quot;sequence&quot; or focus of doing the two decompositions listed above may be either the behaviour (processes)&#xD;
    of the resource or its structure. It may, in a full model, be a mixture of the two. In some circumstances it may be the&#xD;
    case that the structure and broad roles of the constituents of an actor-resource are pre-defined, in which case the&#xD;
    appropriate approach may be to say, at the commencement of detailing some business process, &quot;Let us examine the roles&#xD;
    played by this organisational entity (modelled as an actor-resource), and, concurrently, examine the detail of the&#xD;
    processes in which it is involved.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Alternatively, in some circumstances, it may be more appropriate to say, &quot;We know this thing has to happen, and that&#xD;
    this high level actor-resource makes it happen; let us examine the way it happens (i.e. the things that are done), and&#xD;
    then identify a suitable structure for the high level actor-resource to support it.&quot;&#xD;
