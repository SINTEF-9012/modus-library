    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A service contract approach defines service specifications (the service contract) that define the roles each&#xD;
    participant plays in the service (such as provider and consumer) and the interfaces they implement to play that role in&#xD;
    that service. The service contract represents an agreement between the involved participants for how the service is to&#xD;
    be provided and consumed. This agreement includes the interfaces, choreography and any other terms and conditions.&#xD;
    Service contracts are frequently part of one or more services architectures that define how a set of participants&#xD;
    provide and use services for a particular business purpose or process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An important part of the service contract is the choreography. A choreography is a specification of what is transmitted&#xD;
    and when it is transmitted between participants to enact a service exchange. The choreography defines what happens&#xD;
    between the provider and consumer participants without defining their internal processes - their internal processes do&#xD;
    have to be compatible with their service contracts.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to VDML modelling collaboration is fundamental to modelling business systems. The essence of what is going on&#xD;
    in business is “collaboration”. Value is created through collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    VDML defines a collaboration as a “collection of participants working together for a shared purpose”, whereby a&#xD;
    participant is defined as “anyone or anything that can fill a role in a collaboration”. Participants can be actors&#xD;
    (human or automatons) or collaborations by themselves, or roles of actors or collaborations. An actor is “an individual&#xD;
    (indivisible) participant, which might be human (a person) or non human (e.g. a software agent or machine)”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Basically a business system is constructed as a collaboration of collaborations. An entire enterprise or business&#xD;
    network is a collaboration, and so is any team, project, process, taskforce, etc. VDML also provides the means to align&#xD;
    collaborations with each other and to construct collaborations from other collaborations and individuals (actors).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Participants participate in a collaboration, and as such, collaborate, through roles. Each collaboration defines and&#xD;
    contains a set of roles, a role being “an expected behavior pattern or capability profile associated with participation&#xD;
    in a collaboration”. Roles define what is expected from participants, and what they have to perform, in the specific&#xD;
    context of a collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of role introduces the term “capability”. Capability expectations of roles come from capability&#xD;
    requirements of activities that roles have to perform in collaborations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    A business network is “a collaboration between independent business (or economic) entities, potentially companies,&#xD;
    agencies, individuals or anonymous members of communities of independent business entities, participating in an&#xD;
    economic exchange”. A business network defines a business collaboration of roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A community is “a collaboration of participants with similar interests that work together for some shared purpose such&#xD;
    as sharing knowledge”. A community defines an informal or “weak” collaboration of roles. The collaboration that a&#xD;
    community represents is said to be “informal” and “weak”, as opposed to collaboration in the formal and structured part&#xD;
    of the organization, as defined by organization units. Organization units (or org units) will be discussed later. We&#xD;
    will revisit communities later, and will first focus discussion on business networks.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;
    relate to a transaction, a relationship, a corporate “image” or reputation, etc., values are not actually received by&#xD;
    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;
    basis of exchanging values. Note again that deliverables need not be tangible. They are often intangible. Many values&#xD;
    maybe associated with intangibles. As discussed in 3.1.4, roles perform activity. Activities create and consume value.&#xD;

    There are different ways to measure the “gain” (or lack of it) in a business network (or “business model”). The&#xD;
    metamodel diagram of Business Networks in Figure 15 defines two measured characteristics, to measure “gain” per party:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Profit. Above we discussed modeling and measurement of profit. A profit is realized when the price that the&#xD;
        recipient pays is higher than the provider’s cost.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Value margin. Value margin is the margin that the recipient party in a business network might realize and can be&#xD;
        defined as the difference between proposition value of value propositions received, and “fair market value”, or as&#xD;
        the difference between proposition value and the price that is paid to providers (providing parties in the same&#xD;
        business network) of the corresponding value propositions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Profit is defined from the perspective of the provider of a value proposition. Value margin is defined from the&#xD;
    perspective of the recipient of it. Profit alone is not a sufficient indicator for healthiness of the business network&#xD;
    (“business model”). It is possible that a party realizes profit, but is observing a negative value margin. For&#xD;
    instance, when the recipient of the value proposition associates “equivalent economic value” to a value proposition,&#xD;
    lower than the “fair market price”, or in other words: when the recipient party judges price to pay as higher than the&#xD;
    value it receives.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Measurement of value margin requires that proposition value is measured in economic (monetary) terms. The VDML&#xD;
    metamodel supports modeling of such custom measured characteristics of measureable elements, such as value proposition,&#xD;
    value proposition component, business item and store.&#xD;

    A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together to deliver a tangible&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>Capabilities identify or specify a cohesive set of functions or resources that a service provided by one or more&#xD;
participants might offer. Capabilities can be used by themselves or in conjunction with participants to represent general&#xD;
functionality or abilities that a participant must have. Capabilities are used to identify needed services, and to organize&#xD;
them into catalogues in order to communicate the needs and capabilities of a service area, whether that be business or&#xD;
technology focused, prior to allocating those services to particular participants. Capabilities can have usage dependencies&#xD;
on other capabilities to show how these capabilities are related. Capabilities can also be organized into architectural&#xD;
layers to support separation of concern within the resulting service architecture.</refinedDescription>

    A service contract approach defines service specifications (the service contract) that define the roles each&#xD;
    participant plays in the service (such as provider and consumer) and the interfaces they implement to play that role in&#xD;
    that service. The service contract represents an agreement between the involved participants for how the service is to&#xD;
    be provided and consumed. This agreement includes the interfaces, choreography and any other terms and conditions.&#xD;
    Service contracts are frequently part of one or more services architectures that define how a set of participants&#xD;
    provide and use services for a particular business purpose or process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An important part of the service contract is the choreography. A choreography is a specification of what is transmitted&#xD;
    and when it is transmitted between participants to enact a service exchange. The choreography defines what happens&#xD;
    between the provider and consumer participants without defining their internal processes - their internal processes do&#xD;
    have to be compatible with their service contracts.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A services architecture is a high level description of how participants work together for a purpose by providing and&#xD;
    using services expressed as service contracts. The services architecture defines the requirements for the types of&#xD;
    participants and service realizations that fulfill specific roles. A role defines the basic function (or set of&#xD;
    functions) that an entity may perform in a particular context. In contrast, a participant specifies the type of a party&#xD;
    that fills the role in the context of a specific services architecture. Both service contracts and participants can be&#xD;
    reused when composing different services in other services architectures.&#xD;

    SoaML allows different approaches to specify services. In our practice, we have chosen to combine two different&#xD;
    approaches, as we see one fits more at the business level (service contract approach) and the other at the IT level&#xD;
    (service interface approach). In the business architecture modelling we suggest to use service contracts that are&#xD;
    further refined to service interfaces in the system architecture modelling. The specification of service contracts can&#xD;
    be seen as the refinement of a services architecture. Service contracts are specified as UML collaborations in UML&#xD;
    collaboration diagrams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    An important part of the service contract is the choreography. The choreography is a specification of what is&#xD;
    transmitted and when it is transmitted between parties to enact a service exchange. The choreography specifies&#xD;
    exchanges between the parties - the data, assets and obligations that go between the parties. The choreography defines&#xD;
    what happens between the provider and consumer participants without defining their internal processes - their internal&#xD;
    processes do have to be compatible with their service contracts. The behaviour of the service contract can be described&#xD;
    at the business level using any UML behaviour, e.g. state machines, activity diagrams and sequence diagrams. We&#xD;
    recommend to model the behaviour of any complex service contracts in order to get a better understanding of the&#xD;
    interaction between the roles. This model will later be refined at the IT level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is advisable to create a separate UML Package for the specification of the ServiceContract. Place this package in&#xD;
    the package that contains the ServicesArchitecture. The ServiceContract package will be used for the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specifying&amp;nbsp;the Collaboration for the ServiceContract.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specifying&amp;nbsp;the ServiceInterfaces that represents the consumer and provider role in the ServiceContract.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specifying the Interaction that describes the behaviour of the ServiceContract.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Service Diagrams for the ServiceContract.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
