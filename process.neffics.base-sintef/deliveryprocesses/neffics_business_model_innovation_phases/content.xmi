    A business network is “a collaboration between independent business (or economic) entities, potentially companies,&#xD;
    agencies, individuals or anonymous members of communities of independent business entities, participating in an&#xD;
    economic exchange”. A business network defines a business collaboration of roles.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A community is “a collaboration of participants with similar interests that work together for some shared purpose such&#xD;
    as sharing knowledge”. A community defines an informal or “weak” collaboration of roles. The collaboration that a&#xD;
    community represents is said to be “informal” and “weak”, as opposed to collaboration in the formal and structured part&#xD;
    of the organization, as defined by organization units. Organization units (or org units) will be discussed later. We&#xD;
    will revisit communities later, and will first focus discussion on business networks.&#xD;

    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;

    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;

    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;

    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;

    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;
    relate to a transaction, a relationship, a corporate “image” or reputation, etc., values are not actually received by&#xD;
    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;

    A business network is “a collaboration between independent business (or economic) entities, potentially companies,&#xD;
    agencies, individuals or anonymous members of communities of independent business entities, participating in an&#xD;
    economic exchange”. A business network defines a business collaboration of roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A community is “a collaboration of participants with similar interests that work together for some shared purpose such&#xD;
    as sharing knowledge”. A community defines an informal or “weak” collaboration of roles. The collaboration that a&#xD;
    community represents is said to be “informal” and “weak”, as opposed to collaboration in the formal and structured part&#xD;
    of the organization, as defined by organization units. Organization units (or org units) will be discussed later. We&#xD;
    will revisit communities later, and will first focus discussion on business networks.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;
    relate to a transaction, a relationship, a corporate “image” or reputation, etc., values are not actually received by&#xD;
    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;
    basis of exchanging values. Note again that deliverables need not be tangible. They are often intangible. Many values&#xD;
    maybe associated with intangibles. As discussed in 3.1.4, roles perform activity. Activities create and consume value.&#xD;

    A business network is “a collaboration between independent business (or economic) entities, potentially companies,&#xD;
    agencies, individuals or anonymous members of communities of independent business entities, participating in an&#xD;
    economic exchange”. A business network defines a business collaboration of roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A community is “a collaboration of participants with similar interests that work together for some shared purpose such&#xD;
    as sharing knowledge”. A community defines an informal or “weak” collaboration of roles. The collaboration that a&#xD;
    community represents is said to be “informal” and “weak”, as opposed to collaboration in the formal and structured part&#xD;
    of the organization, as defined by organization units. Organization units (or org units) will be discussed later. We&#xD;
    will revisit communities later, and will first focus discussion on business networks.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These concepts, as highlighted, in the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 24.&#xD;

    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;
    relate to a transaction, a relationship, a corporate “image” or reputation, etc., values are not actually received by&#xD;
    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;
    basis of exchanging values. Note again that deliverables need not be tangible. They are often intangible. Many values&#xD;
    maybe associated with intangibles. As discussed in 3.1.4, roles perform activity. Activities create and consume value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    may contribute to multiple activities in the same collaboration. As the VDML ontology diagram in the figure&#xD;
