  <mainDescription>To determine the usefulness of the technology that is developed in the FInest project, evaluation criteria is needed. The&#xD;
criteria must be designed in a way that show if the technology work towards goals that the different stakeholders have,&#xD;
including goals both for the individual companies of the industry as well as the overall logistic process.&lt;br />&#xD;
When important goals are identified, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) may be found that can be used to measure any change&#xD;
towards the goals.&lt;br />&#xD;
This section gives a short description of the work on designing evaluation criteria. The main work on this topic will be&#xD;
presented in a later delivery 4 â€“ Initial experimentation specification and evaluation methodologies for selected use case&#xD;
scenarios.</mainDescription>
