    <sectionDescription>This can be in the form of already existing customer data, but often the most viable approach is conducting interviews with&#xD;
and/or observations of customers prior to the workshops. Results from customer-studies need to be reported as short&#xD;
customer experience summaries, or developed into personas (Pruitt &amp;amp; Adlin, 2006) to be used as background material in&#xD;
the workshops. A researcher will often be assigned with the responsibility for conducting customer-studies, yet the service&#xD;
provider can also be trusted with this task. Alternatively or additionally customers might be invited as participants in&#xD;
the workshops.</sectionDescription>
