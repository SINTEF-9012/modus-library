    NEFFICS Innovation Community: AT-ONE process&#xD;

&lt;h4>&#xD;
    AT-ONE Service Innovation inside NEFFICS IC&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The AT-ONE process can be partly supported inside the NEFFICS IC. First and foremost it can be used to prepare&#xD;
    workshops, and support execution of the workshop based AT-ONE process, sidelining the real-life workshops with process&#xD;
    and details to help guide the group through the process. Next it can be done to extend the work beyond the workshops&#xD;
    and also to include other participants in ideation and post-workshop activities. When the process is finished, you can&#xD;
    revisit the “AT-ONE” project space and access the resources you gathered during the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    The Process&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.innovation.service_innovation.base-sintef/capabilitypatterns/service_innovation_workflow_5A626264.html&quot;&#xD;
     guid=&quot;_3pc9kaDFEeCXF5ZuS3W32Q&quot;>Service innovation workflow&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;adapted to the constraints and&#xD;
    possibilities that the NEFFICS IC implementation provides. It is defined from the prospective of the facilitator, so&#xD;
    that running the process from A-Z is a full cycle of AT-ONE service innovation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service innovation process that is defined inside the NEFFICS IC is reflecting the job of the facilitator. It is&#xD;
    the facilitator that is moving the process ahead and gatekeeping the activities that he or she manages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The participators of the service innovation process are typically a broad range of employees, or service-users, that&#xD;
    are invited to take part in the process. They will be notified whenever content inside the service innovation project&#xD;
    has changed or generated. Typically they are introduced to the service innovation process by the facilitator, and&#xD;
    invited to attend one or more AT-ONE workshops. Later in the process they can continue work and contributions without&#xD;
    being on the same location.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When adapting the AT-ONE process in our web environment we add a few more steps to the process to make things easier&#xD;
    for the facilitator. This is the additional steps we introduce which was originally&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define core team:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;The core team must consist of participants from the service provider and a&#xD;
        (service) designer, assisting in sketching out workshop documentation (such as service journeys). Other domain&#xD;
        experts may also be included in the core team. One of the team members is assigned the role as a Project leader.&#xD;
        The project leader is responsible for coordinating the Core team and will also be the main facilitator of the&#xD;
        workshops. The team is responsible for preparing the workshops and documents needed in the workshop. This includes&#xD;
        narrowing down the scope of problem areas to be addressed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Identify problem area:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;This is to be done by the core team. It involves collecting&#xD;
        information about the current service journey, identify current challenges, existing KPIs and data yielded from the&#xD;
        existing service offering.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Invite participants:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Domain experts, non-experts, users, designers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The modified process turns out like this:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define core team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify problem area&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prepare workshop&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Invite participants&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify service concepts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of the steps contains tasks for the team as well as tasks for the project leader to execute upon. New tasks could&#xD;
    be added during the execution of the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    The tasks that the facilitators perform&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establish and invite the Core team into the Service innovation Project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Invite a diversified team of participants into the “Service Innovation Challenge”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    The tasks that other participants perform&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the workshop the participants will be able to register their improvement ideas and new service concepts. Both&#xD;
    are registered as “Ideas” in the NEFFICS IC.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    The workshop&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workshop is led by the Project leader. It includes the core team and the other participants.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Startpoint:&lt;/strong> Establishing a common knowledge platform for participants.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Divergence:&lt;/strong> Exploring and generating ideas and solutions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Convergence:&lt;/strong> Synthesis, ranking and decision-making.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the workshop Core team assesses the Idea cards from workshops, and is responsible for refining service&#xD;
    opportunities into service concepts and communicating these with the participants from the workshop, before eventually&#xD;
    evidencing service experiences and presenting these concepts to the management. The service designer assists in&#xD;
    evidencing of new/improved service experiences. The main goals of the AT-ONE process are the identification of new&#xD;
    service concepts.&#xD;
