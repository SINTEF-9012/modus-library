    Detailed example of workshop&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;detailed structure of each workshop may vary. This example describes how the Needs-workshop may look like:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Designing the ideal service for a chosen persona&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    When?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The company needs to modify existing services or design new services so as to better meet the user needs of its&#xD;
    customers. This workshop is particularly useful if a service needs to be better aligned with the needs of narrow&#xD;
    user-segments (allowing workshop-participants to focus on one or two personas).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Who?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Workshop participants should preferably come from different divisions of the organizations, and at least include staff&#xD;
    working with customers and/or product/service-development. Number of workshop attendees should be between 8 and 12.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Expected outcome&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Working with personas will make the workshop participants empathise with the situation and needs of the selected&#xD;
    persona(s). They will become less self-centred and able to sketch service-ideas that are attractive for their&#xD;
    persona(s) (and not for themselves).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Required material&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rich personas-descriptions (e.g. in the form of narratives with photographs).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Post-it notes (two different colours).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pencils, pens, markers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        AT-ONE Needs idea cards.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The service-journey pasted on the wall.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    How?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workshop facilitator and/or needs domain expert gives a 10 minutes introduction to Needs, summarizing the main&#xD;
    points about working with user needs, as well as the aim of the Needs-workshop.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workshop participants will thereafter work in groups of three to five. Each group includes a designer, responsible&#xD;
    for visualizing service-ideas. Workshop groups are given the following tasks, focusing upon one persona at a time&#xD;
    (mirroring the persona feature brainstorm, as explained by Pruitt and Adlin, 2006: 369):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop attendees spend a few minutes studying the persona materials.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Participants summarize motivations, goals and behaviours for the selected persona: these are written down sticky&#xD;
        notes. About 5 minutes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sticky notes from all teams are assembled and posted on wall/window. Duplicate descriptions are kept, emphasizing&#xD;
        certain traits of the persona (e.g. “busy everyday life”). About 5 minutes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each group discusses opportunities for developing services that meet the motivations, goals and behaviours of the&#xD;
        selected persona. Teams use the idea-cards to describe and draw their service-ideas. About 15 minutes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each team is allocated 5 minutes for presenting their ideas. During the presentation, the service-ideas are pasted&#xD;
        on appropriate places on the service-journey. About 15-20 minutes (depending on number of teams).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All attendees get four hearts/stars and hang these on the ideas they prefer the most. About 5 minutes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If time allows it: Steps 1-4 are repeated for the other personas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service innovation ideas are scanned and archived for the final workshop where the totality of service ideas are&#xD;
    evaluated, modified and enhanced.&#xD;
