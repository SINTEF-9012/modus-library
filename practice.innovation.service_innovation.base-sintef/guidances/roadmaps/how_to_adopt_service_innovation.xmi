    Service Innovation&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Service Innovation practice aims at improving the early stages of service innovation, through the integration of&#xD;
    design-thinking into a structured innovation process. Service-Design is emerging as a response to industriesâ€™ needs to&#xD;
    improve service innovation and uses design skills such as customer-insight, cultural understanding, creativity and the&#xD;
    designers ability to create solutions that are attractive and desirable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Principles&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The practice is based on the AT-ONE&amp;nbsp;method (&lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://www.service-innovation.org/&quot;>http://www.service-innovation.org/&lt;/a>). A fundamental characteristic of the&#xD;
    practice&amp;nbsp;is how workshops bring together participants from a service provider, domain-specific expertise and&#xD;
    service designers. The practice&amp;nbsp;is developed to enable participating companies to work with service innovation&#xD;
    within a comprehensive workshop framework, encompassing five lenses:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actors:&lt;/strong> Services are delivered by a collaboration of actors in a value network. There is&#xD;
        considerable opportunity to be gained from innovating services based upon new actor constellations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Touch-points:&lt;/strong> Services are delivered across multiple touch-points (e.g. mobile phone, terms of&#xD;
        service, help-desk) over time. Often, touch points are not exploited well, or are poorly coordinated. Focus upon&#xD;
        touch-points and how new touch-points can be integrated allows a new view of service provision.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Offering:&lt;/strong> Services are usually based upon a core offering. Received offering does not necessarily&#xD;
        reflect the projected offering. By describing a companies projected offering and how this is perceived by the&#xD;
        market, new services can be developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Needs:&lt;/strong> Services should be based upon customer needs, wants and desires. This part of the method&#xD;
        uses this as an innovation start-point.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Experiences:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Services are experiential in nature and experiences can be designed and staged.&#xD;
        By defining desired experiences and developing a vocabulary for this, we hope that services can be developed from&#xD;
        experience-pull rather than the traditional technology-push.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Recommended workflow&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The five A-T-O-N-E lenses are applied in a series of workshops addressing the idea generation stage of the fuzzy front&#xD;
    end of new service development. In this initial stage of the service innovation process, customer input and interaction&#xD;
    is regarded as particularly important (Alam, 2002, 2006). Customer insights therefore play an important role in the&#xD;
    workshops with participants working closely with data from customer interviews or observations, mapping customer&#xD;
    experiences with regard to the services offered by the participating service providers. Customer data need to be&#xD;
    summarized and represented in a concise and lively way for workshop participants to be able to work with the data (they&#xD;
    cannot be expected to read through long reports or customer interview transcripts). Personas represent a particularly&#xD;
    valuable way for communicating actual customer experiences in workshop settings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Figure 1:&lt;/strong> Overview of AT-ONE workflow&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The practice&amp;nbsp;is developed to be scalable and has been carried out with different numbers of participants and with&#xD;
    workshops lasting between 2 and 5 days. A typical &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    workshops and concept-development can be organized as illustrated in figure 1.&#xD;
