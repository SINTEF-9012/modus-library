    NEFFICS Methodology Wiki: Installation guide&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Purpose and functionality&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NEFFICS Methodology is provided as an EPF Wiki (&lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://neffics.modelbased.net/&quot;>http://neffics.modelbased.net/&lt;/a>) and contains a collection of practices. A&#xD;
    practice contains guidelines that describe an approach to solving one or several commonly occurring problems. Practices&#xD;
    enable a compositional approach to building methods. The practice-based approach is supported by the Eclipse Process&#xD;
    Framework (EPF) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/epf/&quot;>http://www.eclipse.org/epf/&lt;/a>) and SEMAT (&lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://www.semat.org/&quot;>http://www.semat.org/&lt;/a>) method engineering communities. Practices can be adapted to&#xD;
    support a range of solutions. In particular, practices can be adapted to suit your organization and supplemented by&#xD;
    your own practices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second release of the NEFFICS Methodology Wiki contains a set of practices derived from method and guideline&#xD;
    descriptions from WP3, WP4 and WP5 deliverables. The current practices are at different maturity and readiness levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Four practices are fairly mature and ready to be used and evaluated by the pilots:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Service innovation:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to do service innovation based on the AT-ONE&#xD;
        method. (This practice is derived from results from WP4.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business model innovation:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to build and innovate your business model&#xD;
        based on the NEFFICS Business Model Innovation Framework (7 building blocks). (This practice is derived from&#xD;
        results from WP4.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business process modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to define business process using BPMN.&#xD;
        (This practice is based on results from WP5.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business service modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to define business services using&#xD;
        Business-SoaML. (This practice is based on results from WP5.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Two practices are still in development and scheduled for release for pilot usage by the end of the year. They should&#xD;
    provide guidelines for how to apply VDML and CMMN that are being standardized as modelling language specifications in&#xD;
    the OMG.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Value delivery modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice contains concepts and examples derived from the OMG&#xD;
        proposal for VDML [OMG 2011a].&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Case management modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice contains concepts and examples from the OMG proposal for&#xD;
        CMMN [OMG 2012].&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One practice is currently just a placeholder for guidelines to be developed in the last phase of the NEFFICS project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Value Analysis:&lt;/strong> This practice currently is just a placeholder for guidelines to be&#xD;
        developed and derived from Deliverable D3.5 scheduled for release at M30.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All of the practices listed above are being developed and maintained in the NEFFICS project. In addition the NEFFICS&#xD;
    Methodology also contains a few practices (for reference) that have been developed in the SHAPE project:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Services architecture and contract modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to define the business&#xD;
        view of the service-oriented architecture using SoaML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Service interface and component modelling:&lt;/strong> This practice describes how to define the IT&#xD;
        specification view of the service-oriented architecture using SoaML.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The practices are defined in the EPF framework and are based on a common NEFFICS core or kernel. Basing the practices&#xD;
    on a common kernel allows us to define reusable and composable practices. A selection of appropriate practices from the&#xD;
    NEFFICS methodology (i.e., the collection of NEFFICS practices) can be configured for a specific usage at a certain&#xD;
    time. Additional practices can later be added to the method if required. Figure 21 illustrates the approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Requirements and installation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NEFFICS Methodology Wiki is available as a hosted EPF Wiki installation (http://neffics.modelbased.net/) that has&#xD;
    been configured for the NEFFICS project. The EPF Wiki is hosted on a virtual machine running Linux. An installation&#xD;
    guide for EPF Wiki is available online (&lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://wiki.eclipse.org/EPF_Wiki_Installation_Guide_for_Ubuntu&quot;>http://wiki.eclipse.org/EPF_Wiki_Installation_Guide_for_Ubuntu&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The EPF Wiki used for the NEFFICS Methodology Wiki has been tested with Internet Explorer and Firefox with the&#xD;
    following results:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Internet Explorer 9:&lt;/strong> Works for reading the Wiki pages, but some Wiki functionalities for authoring&#xD;
        practices are not working properly. Doing minor edits, e.g., adding comments still works.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Firefox 10:&lt;/strong> Works for both reading and editing Wiki pages. No known issues.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most users of the NEFFICS Methodology Wiki will probably not use the Wiki authoring functionalities to edit the&#xD;
    practices, but mostly just do minor edits on existing pages (e.g., revise or comment on existing guidelines), and for&#xD;
    this purpose any of the two tested web browsers work fine. If you plan on doing more serious editing on the EPF Wiki we&#xD;
    recommend using the Firefox web browser.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The content of the Wiki (i.e., the published practices) is also available as a separate download which can be extracted&#xD;
    to a local storage for offline browsing, or published on your own EPF Wiki installation. In addition the full&#xD;
    methodology source is available as an EPF library which can be imported into the EPF Composer tool and fully edited,&#xD;
    extended, integrated and adapted to suit your organization and supplemented by your own practices. The NEFFICS&#xD;
    Methodology is licensed under EPL 1.0 and puts no restriction regarding its use or customization. However, note that&#xD;
    any customization of the NEFFICS Methodology requires good knowledge and experience with the EFP framework and the EPF&#xD;
    Composer tool in particular.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The EPF Composer tool can be downloaded from&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a&#xD;
        href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/epf/downloads/tool/tool_downloads.php&quot;>http://www.eclipse.org/epf/downloads/tool/tool_downloads.php&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EPF Composer requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5 or higher to be installed.&#xD;
