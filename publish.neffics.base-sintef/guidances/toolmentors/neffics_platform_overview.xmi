    NEFFICS Platform:&amp;nbsp;Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Architectural Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/neffics_platform_architecture_1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NEFFICS Platform is grouped into five main areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Networked Innovation Community&lt;/strong> provides the innovation services for idea, challenge and&#xD;
        innovation management.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Business analysis modelling&lt;/strong> provides the collaborative cloud based, VDML implementation that&#xD;
        enables model based Enterprise design and transformation, over and above the model driven platform that&#xD;
        enables&lt;br />&#xD;
        application development.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Business automation modelling&lt;/strong> provides support for models that can be automated and directly&#xD;
        supported through the business operations runtime.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Business operations runtime&lt;/strong> provides services for execution of models, management of work to&#xD;
        be performed as part of model execution, and monitoring of model execution and business data that is generated as a&#xD;
        result&lt;br />&#xD;
        of model execution, all in a distributed service-oriented architecture context.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Internet of Services and Things&lt;/strong> area includes third party services, including COIN and ASPIRE,&#xD;
        that provide access to underlying services for collaboration, interoperability, sensor and RFID information.&#xD;
        Services of&lt;br />&#xD;
        enterprise applications, available on premise of use case partners, can be positioned in this area as well.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Use of the NEFFICS Practices and Frameworks in the NEFFICS Platform&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NEFFICS Platform provides tools and services that build upon the baseline functionality for innovation community&#xD;
    and business operations extended with support for the NEFFICS Methodologies and Frameworks:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Networked Innovation Models&lt;/strong> define frameworks for different innovation types, starting from&#xD;
        business model innovation and further supporting service, process and product innovation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Networked Business Value Analysis Models&lt;/strong> define frameworks and methods for business value&#xD;
        analysis, including the VDML specification.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;strong>Networked Process and Service Models&lt;/strong> define frameworks and methods for process and service&#xD;
        modelling, supporting process and service innovation. It also includes the CMMN specification.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/neffics_methodologies_and_frameworks.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;469&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The figure shows relationships between the various NEFFICS Methodologies and Frameworks, and the various tools and&#xD;
    services of the NEFFICS Platform. These relationships suggest which tools and services have been improved or developed&#xD;
    based on which methodologies and frameworks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Representation of BMs, which are at the core of BMI, is supported by the BM Designer in the Platform. Structured and&#xD;
    detailed representations of elements of BMs, as well as of “relationships” between elements, both within a BM and&#xD;
    across BMs, are supported by VDML Designer, as integrated with BM Designer. BMI Process support in the Networked&#xD;
    Innovation Community (NIC) implements core BMI and BMIL process concepts. Regarding BMIL support, implementation focus&#xD;
    so far has been more on essentials than on compliance with specific BMIL strategy representation formats, as proposed&#xD;
    by D4.3.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    VDML covers the essentials of the Value Flow Model concept of the Business Value Framework. VDML allows business value&#xD;
    analysis, and supports Value Flow Model concepts, at any “value level”. “Value types”, as proposed by D3.2, can be&#xD;
    defined in VDML-based Value Libraries, and from there applied in VDML-based business design and analysis. VDML comes&#xD;
    with an integrated measurement framework, to support measurement aspects of value creation / distribution /consumption&#xD;
    and value impact and provides a foundation for “value formula”. The VDML Designer provides an integrated solution for&#xD;
    these concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ServiceML models are supported by the Service Modelling Editor. Service concepts in ServiceML have been aligned with&#xD;
    VDML, enabling potential integration of Service Modelling Editor with VDML Designer, though this integration might not&#xD;
    be achieved in NEFFICS itself. CMMN Designer, representing the modelling part of the Case Management solution in the&#xD;
    NEFFICS Platform, has served as a leading implementation in the development of the CMMN standard. As the CMMN standard&#xD;
    has now gone through adoption in the OMG, it is intended to implement any upcoming improvement, especially use-case&#xD;
    driven, in a way that increases the level of compliance with CMMN. NEFFICS methodology and related practices are&#xD;
    maintained in the NEFFICS methodology tool.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Tool Mentors&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Accompanying the NEFFICS Platform we have the public &lt;strong>NEFFICS Methodology Wiki&lt;/strong> which provides&#xD;
    descriptive guidelines in the form of practices for how to apply and adopt the models, methodologies and tools provided&#xD;
    by the NEFFICS Platform and Frameworks. We have developed a set of tool mentors&amp;nbsp;that are linked to the&#xD;
    relevant&amp;nbsp;tasks prescribed by the&amp;nbsp;practices of the&amp;nbsp;NEFFICS Methodology:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        guid=&quot;_MZ2doCdWEeKDGNEPRzZzCg&quot;>NEFFICS Methodology Wiki&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Note that some of the tools are not publicly available, so in this release only public content are presented.&#xD;
    Additional tool mentors will be developed for the final release of the NEFFICS Methodology release.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Other Architectural Views&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A number of architectural pictures highlighting different perspectives have been created during the NEFFICS project. In&#xD;
    sub-sections below we will demonstrate how the current NEFFICS Platform architecture is consistent with these earlier&#xD;
    representations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Conceptual Architecture for Integration&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/model_based_integration.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;461&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This figure describes the approach for model-based integration and&amp;nbsp;illustrates a traditional multi-layered&#xD;
    architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The bottom layer consists of the NEFFICS platforms which provide the back-end infrastructure. &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The Networked Innovation Management Platform represents the Networked Innovation Community (NIC) component&#xD;
                of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The Networked Operations Business Platform represents the combination of the Business Analysis Modeling,&#xD;
                Business Automation Modeling and Business Operations Runtime components of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The open-source modelling framework Oryx is the framework that is used to develop the Service Modeling&#xD;
                Editor of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The open-source methodology framework EPF is the framework that is used to develop the NEFFCS Methodology&#xD;
                tool of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The middle layer comprises the tools, services and methods developed in NEFFICS. Here we have identified the&#xD;
        following services: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Networked Innovation Community Services is similar to Networked Innovation Community (NIC) in the NEFFICS&#xD;
                Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Innovation, Leadership &amp;amp; Management (ILM) Services actually represents the BMI Process tools and its&#xD;
                integrations, in the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Business Model Innovation, Value Analysis Framework and Business Process &amp;amp; Case Management correspond&#xD;
                with Network Innovation Models, Networked Business Value Analysis Models and Networked Process and Service&#xD;
                Models methodology and framework areas.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Service Modelling relates to ServiceML models part in Networked Process and Service Models, as well as to&#xD;
                the Service Modeling Editor in the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                NEFFICS Methodology represents the Methodology FW part of Networked Process and Service Models, as well as&#xD;
                the NEFFICS Methodology tool of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The top layer represents a portal front-end that exposes the correct functionality and services to different users&#xD;
        (e.g., end-users, application composers and business analysts) through different “MashApps” or composite&#xD;
        applications. This layer is not represented as a tool or service as such in the NEFFICS Platform, but is realized&#xD;
        through the integrated user interface of the NEFFICS Platform itself, as well as user interfaces of “MashApps” that&#xD;
        are developed (composed) based on it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The fourth logical layer illustrates the model-based integration approach to formalized models and modelling&#xD;
        languages in NEFFICS. Strictly spoken it need not be positioned as a part of the architecture of the NEFFICS&#xD;
        Platform, though each part of it has a clear correspondance with it. BMI, VDML, CMMN and Business SoaML are also&#xD;
        represented in the NEFFICS Methodologies and Frameworks. BPMN is supported in the NEFFICS Platform by the BPMN&#xD;
        Process Designer. SPEM is the engineering process standard that is used to implement the Methodology tool in the&#xD;
        NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The parts of Internet of Services &amp;amp; Internet of Things, as well as Legacy Applications correspond with the Internet&#xD;
    of Services and Things part of the NEFFICS Platform. Integration Services do not only relate to COIN and ASPIRE, but&#xD;
    also to the SOA Grid Connectors tool in the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    User View of the NEFFICS Platform&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/user_view.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This figure represents a user view of the NEFFICS Platform. It has a dual nature:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The bottom parts are directly reconcilable with tools and services in the NEFFICS Platform, as well as related&#xD;
        NEFFICS methodologies and frameworks. Innovation Community represents the Networked Innovation Community (NIC) of&#xD;
        the NEFFICS Platform. Value Flow Framework, Business Model Framework and Processes and Services relate to the VDML&#xD;
        Designer, BMI Canvas/ BM Designer and Service Modeling Editor tools in the NEFFICS Platform respectively, together&#xD;
        with their NEFFICS Methodology and Framework counterparts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The oval with “Cases” on top articulates the user view on the overarching innovation process, which is implemented&#xD;
        based on the tools and services in the Networked Innovation Community component, as integrated with other tools and&#xD;
        services, in the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    NEFFICS Platform Architecture&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/neffics_platform_architecture.png&quot; width=&quot;567&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This figure positions the NEFFICS Platform more from a technology, or systems components, perspective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The bottom layer represents the three “technology platforms” that are underlying the NEFFICS Platform. Innovation&#xD;
    Communit Infrastructure (Induct) relates to the Networked Innovation Community components of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
    Business Operations Platform (BOP) relates to the Business Analysis Modeling, Business Automation Modeling and Business&#xD;
    Operations Runtime components of the NEFFICS Platform respectively. The Web-based Modeling &amp;amp; Method Framework&#xD;
    Infrastructure relates to both the Service Modeling Editor and the NEFFICS Methodology tools of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
    These three technology platforms run, during NEFFICS in their respective clouds, which are interoperable, together&#xD;
    representing a virtual and distributed Cloud Infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The middle layer provides a high-level and technology-oriented view on the tools and services of the NEFFICS Platform.&#xD;
    Innovation Process Management denotes the tools and services in the Networked Innovation Community (NIC) component.&#xD;
    Composite Application Framework (also as basis for Customer-Built Apps) reconciles with tools and services in the&#xD;
    Business Analysis Modeling, Business Automation Modeling and Business Operations Runtime components of the NEFFICS&#xD;
    Platform. The essence of what is supported by the Business Analysis Modeling tool is underhighlighted, as it merely&#xD;
    focuses on the “automation modeling” and “execution”. Not so much on business design and analysis capabilities of the&#xD;
    NEFFICS Platform. As such, the architecture is less complete than the other representations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Methods and Guidelines relate to the NEFFICS Methodology tool in the NEFFICS Platform. The fact that social&#xD;
    collaboration is supported in the various parts of the NEFFICS Platform is represented by the stretched Social&#xD;
    Collaboration Platform block. It does, amongst others, reconcile with the Social Collaboration service in the NEFFICS&#xD;
    Platform.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt&quot; class=&quot;MsoBodyText&quot;>&#xD;
    Web Front-End is, like also “Portal”, not represented as a tool or service as such in the NEFFICS Platform, but is&#xD;
    realized through the integrated user interface of the NEFFICS Platform itself, as well as user interfaces of “MashApps”&#xD;
    that are developed (composed) based on it. The “Users” layer is not really a component of architecture, but is included&#xD;
    to articulate the user-oriented focus of NEFFICS, as well as that the NEFFICS Platform supports various types of roles.&#xD;
