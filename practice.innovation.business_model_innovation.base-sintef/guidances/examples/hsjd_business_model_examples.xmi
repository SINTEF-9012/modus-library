    HSJD: Business model examples&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The hospital belongs to the Hospital Order of Saint John of God and is a private, non-profit hospital. The order is&#xD;
    represented in more than 50 countries and has almost 300 healthcare centers worldwide. HSJD is located in Barcelona,&#xD;
    Spain, and is a children and maternity care center. HSJD was the first (in 2007) hospital in Spain to establish a&#xD;
    department of innovation. In HSJD they call it the innovation department – but in our use case we call it BMI&#xD;
    department as we consider all BMI as the tree of innovation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    High Risk Pregnancy&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    HSJD hospital handles and treat about 4000 pregnancy cases pr. year. 10 % of these pregnancy cases are high risk cases,&#xD;
    where the women are in high risk of losing her baby. To postpone the childbirth, the doctor stops these complications&#xD;
    and exposes the woman to a daily maternal-fetal monitoring control.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    In a number of cases, this control involves the patient's admissions to the hospital. Today it is possible to sensor&#xD;
    and measure heart rate and other key measurements from the child inside the mother. Those machines and equipment that&#xD;
    can measure the child works very well today and nurses can do all the work on preparing and measuring the data from the&#xD;
    child by these. Today the ”AS IS” BM works as the mother leaves her home for a 30 minute visit at the HSJD hospital,&#xD;
    where a nurse makes the measurements of the child by putting the equipment on the mothers “tommy”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hsjd_figure_59.png&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;164&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 59: RPU&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Doctors and staff at HSJD have worked already 2 years to find technical solutions and a “TO BE” BM to the challenge and&#xD;
    market of risk pregnancy. The result of this work have shown the following challenges seen from HSJD´s perspective:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Cost challenge – the technic is not cheap enough - technology has to be cheap enough to implement. One&#xD;
            technology cost 3000 dollars with camera, screen and so on pr. mother.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Price Challenge – HSJD will not and cannot charge the mother&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Provider and cost challenges - West wireless institute, California US – has already developed ”a baby sensor” –&#xD;
            which cost 25000 US dollar. They are interested – how much exactly they are interest is not known yet.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            University of Barcelona has also developed a device but this is not tested in real environment&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            The solution has been presented to the medical house – with Philips Monitor Careview equipment – however&#xD;
            Philips does not want to take the risk of tele-measuring pregnancy yet.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            Physician Challenge – it is well known that the measurement can come out with false negative and false positive&#xD;
            measurement – the Doctors/Physicians relying on the new device might then risk falling into some wrong&#xD;
            conclusion.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            HSJD is thinking about how HSJD can involve other physicians outside – near the mother – so the HSJD doctors&#xD;
            and experts do not need to be directly involved and HSJD´s ”market area” can be increased&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    When we firstly was presented to the “TO BE” Risk Pregnancy BM use case we were not aware of the multitude of the “TO&#xD;
    BE” BM and BMI potential that really is potential and could be potential for HSJD. This has to be very carefully&#xD;
    studied before making the final choice for one or two “TO BE” BMs. The figure beneath illustrates the map of “AS IS”&#xD;
    BMs and “TO BE” BMs registered in HSJD today&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hsjd_figure_60.png&quot; width=&quot;527&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 60: A sketch model of the BMI and BM projects in focus in RPU use case analysis related to BM and BMI&#xD;
    lifecycle – has to be adjusted&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    The RPU “TO BE” BM is a new BMI initiative from HSJD’s management – increasing HSJD´s activities to also doing RPU with&#xD;
    support of high technology equipment. Therefore this initiative involves a whole new platform of value propositions&#xD;
    from HSJD, which could be classified as to some degree radical innovation on the Value proposition building block.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    The RPU center is in the first phase addressing a well-known user and customer group but in future also addressing new&#xD;
    user and customer group external to the hospital, which will to some extent be radical related to previous target&#xD;
    groups. However, we classify this change in first phase as incremental – however, HSJD must be aware that the&#xD;
    customers’ environment is now outside HSJD´s control – which can be risky.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    The value chain setup and functions that has to be carried out in the RPU “TO BE” BM are new related to some functions&#xD;
    – however, HSJD have great experience in the internal and core functions - of handling the functions of RPU Women. The&#xD;
    functions outside the HSJD hospital are new to HSJD and some of these are also outsourced to network partners as can be&#xD;
    seen beneath.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    HSJD has until now taken most of the value chain functions around the handling of users, customers and participants of&#xD;
    RPU women together with a well-developed handling program and now suddenly the “TO BE” BM involves other partners and&#xD;
    it can therefore be classified as a NBBM (D 4.3.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    So this is all new to the HSJD pregnancy department – to some extent radical BMI – however, they solved this via&#xD;
    outsourcing some of the functions to professional network partners – Telecom companies, Equipment providers e.g.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Competences also have to be developed technology, HR, organizational systems and maybe also the culture. This can also&#xD;
    mean radical innovation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Network partners are new - relations are not known relations especially on external network partners. However, all the&#xD;
    relations internal in the BM are known but have to be build up from scratch. Therefore we also classify the change on&#xD;
    the network building block as kind of radical.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    The RPU “TO BE” BM value formula is not known yet – but it seems as if it will be different to other BMs in HSJD as its&#xD;
    point of entry is related to different success criteria and different value formulae than profit and other BMs in HSJD.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    With these characteristics we would classify the Darwin BM as seen in the table beneath.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hsjd_table_17.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Table 17: Classification of Incremental and radical BM innovation related to the 7 building blocks for the RPU&#xD;
    “TO BE” BM has to be adjusted with green and red color&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    Seen in another diagram the RPU’s “TO BE” BM could be characterized, to some extent, as a risk project as it is&#xD;
    changing some building blocks related to the “AS IS” RPU BM in HSJD as can be seen above.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    This is very much dependent on which of the several RPU “TO BE” BMs HSJD choose to implement. In this portray we&#xD;
    propose the space in which the RPU “TO BE” BM can be positioned in terms of its degree of innovativeness by means of&#xD;
    its radicality, reach and complexity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hsjd_figure_61.png&quot; width=&quot;385&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 61: A three-dimensional business model innovation scale – Risk, Complexity and Reach of the RPU “TO BE”&#xD;
    BM&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    As can be seen the RPU “TO BE” BM is radical on innovation of building blocks and it is also complex as it is changing&#xD;
    6 out of 7 building blocks. Finally it can also be classified as far on reach as it is addressing a BM new to the&#xD;
    business, market and industry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    As also agreed upon the presentation of the 3 BMI use cases in details are decided by the Neffics consortium to be&#xD;
    documented within WP2 D.2.3. Therefore, for further detail about the use cases please see WP2.&#xD;
