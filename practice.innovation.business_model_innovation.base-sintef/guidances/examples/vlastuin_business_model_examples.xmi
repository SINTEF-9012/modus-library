    Vlastuin: Business model examples&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Vlastuin is a business started in 1959 and located in Netherlands. Vlastuin employs around 150 people and had turnover&#xD;
    of 27 million EUR in 2011. During more than 50 years of presence Vlastuin have added more BMs to its business and&#xD;
    thereby slowly increased its core business. Starting off by installing and servicing furnaces and boilers, through&#xD;
    gradual business manufacturing to adding also assembling of cranes and parts to the business. Graphical representation&#xD;
    of Vlastuin business evolvement can be seen in Figure 37.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_37.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 37: Vlastuin’s business evolvement&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Neffics project Vlastuin was mainly and initially interested in exploring its existing BMs and has provided two&#xD;
    business cases to explore. We use these two business cases in order to show how one business can have more “AS IS”&#xD;
    operational BMs simultaneously.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Crane business case&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first business case provided by Vlastuin is production of the crane booms. This business started due to the&#xD;
    evolvement of the crane producers (Customers) outsourcing crane boom production (Value chain functions). A crane boom&#xD;
    is the extendable and retraceable arm of the crane (product) which lifts the loads. See Figure 38.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_38.png&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 38: An example of a Vlastuin Crane boom on trucks&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Vlastuin as a manufacturer of D-Tec container trailers had competences of accurate bending and high quality welding of&#xD;
    large heavy pieces of steel, which was exactly what crane producers were looking for. Currently Vlastuin is a provider&#xD;
    of the crane booms to crane manufacturers throughout Europe. This particular case is focusing on the truck cranes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The BM is related to three major stakeholders: Truck crane producers (Customer), Crane boom providers (Network partner)&#xD;
    and Metal sheet supplier (Network Partner). Each of these will be shortly introduced presenting their roles and&#xD;
    interconnections between each other.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Truck crane producer business case (OEM customer)&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Truck crane producer, as the name implies, produces the cranes and mounts them on the truck. Often they outsource part&#xD;
    manufacturing and focus more on final product. Part of the outsourced manufacturing is boom production, where Vlastuin&#xD;
    specializes. The truck crane producer has extensive knowledge (Competence) on crane boom manufacturing since it was&#xD;
    originally manufactured in house. Therefore, they demand same or even higher quality for the outsourced parts (Value&#xD;
    proposition). Furthermore, in this specific crane boom part provided by Vlastuin, the truck crane producer also has a&#xD;
    contract with a metal sheet supplier making sure that the raw material meets the specifications for manufacturing&#xD;
    (Value proposition).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Crane boom provider&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Crane boom provider, or in this case Vlastuin, manufactures (Value chain functions) crane boom parts based on the&#xD;
    customer specifications (Value Proposition). This process starts with the creation of the production drawings and&#xD;
    product quality plan by a specialized engineer. Afterwards special sheet metal is ordered from the supplier. After raw&#xD;
    materials are received the production processes launches. Three major steps in production are laser cutting, sheet&#xD;
    bending and certified welding. Laser cutting involves cutting out various boom components of the sheet metal plates&#xD;
    using laser. This provides high quality cutting edges and very precise component dimensions. Sheet bending is where&#xD;
    high dimension heavy components are bent at right angles according to predefined sequences. In order to obtain exact&#xD;
    bend angles very precise laser angle measurements are performed during the process. Certified welding is performed with&#xD;
    high-end welding equipment by certified welders due to safety regulations of truck cranes. Here the separate boom&#xD;
    components are welded together in a pre-set welding order. This is to avoid crane boom getting twisted due to the heat&#xD;
    transfer and thick metal, causing later problems in crane boom operation. After all the production processes are&#xD;
    carried out and quality is insured, separate welding assemblies are grouped together and sent to the customer&#xD;
    production line.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Beneath we have summarized the value chain function and process that Vlastuin addresses. It also indicates some of the&#xD;
    tangible and intangible value propositions that Vlastuin takes care of together with some of the competences embedded&#xD;
    in Vlastuin’s BM. Further it gives an overall view of the relations inside the specific BM.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Sheet metal provider&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Specifications meeting sheet metal is supplied by a sheet metal provider after the truck crane provider sends out a&#xD;
    stock release order assigning certain amount of stock to the crane boom provider. Due to its long manufacturing&#xD;
    processes these are manufactured in batches and kept in stock. After receiving an order the sheet metal is transported&#xD;
    to the crane boom provider.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a very overall graphical overview of the Vlastuin crane business case we have drawn up this figure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_39.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 39: Vlastuin Cranes Business Case Overview&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although the business case description is quiet detailed the business case still not provide us with details enough&#xD;
    about different BMs inside Vlastuin related to this business case and further the BMs of Vlastuin’s network partners.&#xD;
    Further some building blocks are missing in the Vlastuin BM – e.g. value formula of the crane boom provider. This we&#xD;
    have received later on in our workshop but this is confidential information which we cannot present here. In the next&#xD;
    case we will however be able to go a little deeper into another of Vlastuins BMs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Paperless manure transportation business case&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The next business case from Vlastuin is manure transportation data administration. In the Netherlands it is by law&#xD;
    decided that in order to transport manure authorities have to be notified at start and end of the transportation with&#xD;
    manure samples. Due to these regulations Vlastuin started providing AGR –units (Dutch for Automatic Data Registration)&#xD;
    (value proposition). This unit sends data to the Vlastuin server where it is filtered and forwarded to the authorities&#xD;
    (Users). By doing this it dramatically decreasing processing time and paper work needed for manure transportation&#xD;
    (Value proposition for the user). There are eight significant stakeholders in this business case which will be shortly&#xD;
    introduced next.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Manure producer&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A manure producer is usually a livestock farmer (customers’ customer) who has excessive amount of manure. Farmers&#xD;
    usually has a contract with the manure transporter (manure transporter will be explained in more detail later on)&#xD;
    (Customer) which means that all the work that comes with manure transportation is done by the manure transporter. Some&#xD;
    examples could be that the manure transporter is responsible for finding manure consumers (Customers’ customer), or the&#xD;
    manure transporter is responsible for all the paper work around the manure transportation (Customers’ value proposition&#xD;
    demand). The cost associated with manure transportation is deducted from manure producers’ payment for manure. The&#xD;
    manure producer gets a digital version of the paperwork from the manure transporter.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Manure consumer&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The manure consumer (Customers’ customer) is usually the farmer who needs the manure as fertilizer for his fields&#xD;
    (Customers’ customers’ (upstream) value proposition requirement). The manure consumer has a contract with the manure&#xD;
    transporter which includes all the work associated with manure transportation (Customers’ customers’ (downstream) value&#xD;
    proposition). Manure consumers get the invoice for manure together with the digital copy of the paperwork.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Manure transporter&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Manure transporter is the direct customer of Vlastuin. This usually is the transportation company which transports&#xD;
    manure from manure producer to manure consumer. Manure transporter has contract with both manure producer and consumer,&#xD;
    and dispatches tank trailers to manure producers upon the request. During loading of manure to the tank samples of the&#xD;
    manure are packaged into the sealed bags, as can be seen in Figure 40.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_40.png&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 40: Manure sample bag&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These samples are fitted with barcodes (added value proposition) which are scanned and sent to the authorities together&#xD;
    with other required information. This is automatically performed by the AGR – unit via an infrastructure provider&#xD;
    service (internal business network partner value proposition). After receiving confirmation from the authorities about&#xD;
    successful transmission the manure is transported to the manure consumer. The manure consumer is automatically&#xD;
    determined by GPS data (added value proposition) combined with manure administration data (added value proposition)&#xD;
    thus identifying the closest manure consumer location. Before transportation the consumer needs to confirm if he wants&#xD;
    to receive the manure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Infrastructure provider&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The manure infrastructure provider, in this case the ICT department in Vlastuin, is providing the platform for data&#xD;
    transferring and registration (Value proposition). Vlastuin has a server stack which acts as a communication center for&#xD;
    manure transportation (Competence – technology, HR, Organizational system internal BM in Vlastuin). The AGR –unit (see&#xD;
    Figure 41 beneath) sends information to the servers with GPS coordinates and scanned sample bag barcodes together with&#xD;
    other information. The servers (Network partners internal Vlastuin) immediately filter out only mandatory information&#xD;
    and send this data (value chain functions at internal BM in Vlastuin) to authorities. Authorities sends back a&#xD;
    notification to the servers informing if the transaction was successful (external network partners value proposition&#xD;
    and value chain functions in BM) where it is forwarded to the AGR- unit allowing further processes for manure&#xD;
    transportation. In the case where the transaction is not confirmed (which is very infrequent) the problem is addressed&#xD;
    manually by calling the authorities and further addressing the problem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_41.png&quot; width=&quot;452&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 41: AGR Unit&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The manure administrator is also connected to the server, which allows access to the laboratory results even though the&#xD;
    laboratory (external network partner in the BM) is not connected to the servers directly. All this data can be accessed&#xD;
    through the AGR website where the manure transporter provides additional functionalities such as Track-n-Trace&#xD;
    (transport movement insights) and consumer specific accounting data. The AGR – unit is sold with attached service&#xD;
    contact including mobile data connection necessary for communication with the data servertogether with firmware updates&#xD;
    of the unit, and software updates for AGR web site. In addition to the AGR – unit, Vlastuin also provides D-TEC&#xD;
    sampling units which takes the manure samples and packages them to the plastic bags as seen in Figure 40. This unit&#xD;
    also comes with a servicing contract together with consumables and spare parts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Manure Administrator&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Administrator (Network partner) provides administrative services (network partners’ value proposition and&#xD;
    value chain function) to meet the requirements of the fertilizer law. One of the examples could be the application of&#xD;
    manure accounting ID from the ministry (value proposition to user demands). The Manure Administrator also feeds data&#xD;
    from laboratory results of the manure samples. The Manure Administrator acts as a middle man between authorities and&#xD;
    manure transporter, therefore only the final data is uploaded to the authorities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Laboratory&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Laboratory (network partner) receives the manure samples for assessment of its value. It identifies the manure&#xD;
    producer or receiver by the barcode, and returns their findings to authorities and the Manure Administrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Authorities&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this particular case the authority is the Ministry of Agriculture and Nature management and Fisheries (Users) in&#xD;
    Netherlands. They receive the manure transporting data combined with the laboratory results (Combined value&#xD;
    proposition).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Regulator&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the AID (Dutch for General Inspection Service) (User) in the Netherlands. They are making sure all the&#xD;
    requirements are met by all the participating parties in the manure transporting process. This includes checking&#xD;
    farmers, manure transporter infrastructure provider, manure administrator and even the authorities themselves. If any&#xD;
    of the requirements are violated the business (or private party) violating is given a fine (Value proposition by user).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_42.png&quot; width=&quot;471&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 42: Vlastuin Business Cases and Business Models&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 42 illustrates how, on a theoretical perspective, at least two “AS IS” BMs can be seen in this particular Manure&#xD;
    transportation business case. Vlastuin not only has two simultaneously operational business cases, but looking into&#xD;
    manure transportation with just some simple business modeling details shows that the same business case – the Manure&#xD;
    transportation Business case has at least two “AS IS” BMs. This further strengthens the points risen before about the&#xD;
    multi BM definition (Lindgren, et al., 2011) on argumentation about possible multitude of BMs in the same business or&#xD;
    business case. An overall graphical overview can be found in the following illustrations of manure loading,&#xD;
    transportation and unloading business case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_43.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 43: Vlastuin Business Cases and Business Models loading Manure&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_44.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 44: Vlastuin’s Business Cases and BMs for Manure Transportation&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vlastuin_figure_45.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 45: Vlastuin’s Business Cases and BMs for unloading Manure&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To clarify further the processes in the manure transportation and different stakeholders’ process flow chart please see&#xD;
    WP 1 documentation. In order to more easily understand the flow charts, the transportation processes have been split&#xD;
    into loading, transportation and unloading.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As can be seen in this very fragmented and small part of the Vlastuin’s business, there are many ”AS IS” BMs in&#xD;
    operation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It can also be seen that many business partners – network partners - in the overview are shown each with their “AS IS”&#xD;
    BMs. We have no full picture of the network partners’ BMs and how many BMs from the network partners are involved at&#xD;
    the moment, as we do not have a full data on these. We hope to get this on a later perspective to get a full picture of&#xD;
    the NBBM environment.&#xD;
