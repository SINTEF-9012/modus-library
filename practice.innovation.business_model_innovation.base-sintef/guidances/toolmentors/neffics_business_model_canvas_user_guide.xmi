    NEFFICS Business Model Canvas: User guide&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Cloud-based installation (URL)&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://Beta.induct.no&quot;>http://Beta.induct.no&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    User guide&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The canvas is found in the menu “Portfolio” and item “ Business Workspaces”.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Start by creating a canvas in the folder “Your Canvas Workspaces” by using the button to the right.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Click the link “Open” to get to the canvas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Click in a block and choose “Add Component” to make a new canvas component. Changes are saved automatically.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    The Business Model Repository Service&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A shared business model repository accessible from all NEFFICS Services was important to be able to facilitate the&#xD;
    “Closed Innovation Loop” where both Innovation processes, innovation initiatives and the modeler has strong&#xD;
    relationship to business model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The statuses of a BM are important to maintain throughout the NEFFICS Platform since it provides the basis of a lot of&#xD;
    process and portfolio work. We have adopted the basis from Work Package 4 that every Business Model that are put into&#xD;
    “life” follows a lifecycle where it after its birth goes through a lot of versions until it is exhausted and gets&#xD;
    retired in the end. During this journey it is target for inter-business model innovation campaigns and intra-business&#xD;
    model innovation leadership exercises.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The provided Business Model Repository has very basic, but important functionality:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Platform-Unique Identifier&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Status of the Business Model (Running, Proposed, Retired)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Access List (Who are able to access the Business Model)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Name&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Description&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Canvas (Compliant with the 6 sided Cube of NEFFICS WP4 internal relationship definitions)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The resources are accessed from other NEFFICS services through REST API, which enables Listing, Creation, Updates,&#xD;
    Reading, Deletion of the business Models.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    The Business Model Canvas Navigator&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Model Navigator is where you maintain your Business Model portfolio. This is a basic UI that make use of&#xD;
    the Business Model Repository Service. It encapsulates the functionality of the aforementioned Business Model&#xD;
    Repository Service.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    The Business Model Canvas Editor&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
The Canvas editor consists of a canvas surface which contains blocks where the users can add components. These components&#xD;
are simple descriptive items in this implementation, but a natural step in the progression towards connection with&#xD;
underlying value network models.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/business_model_canvas_editor.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On the left side we have a pane where one can switch between different canvas layout. On the right side there is a&#xD;
    Layer manager, where one can organize the different components into layers. This is purely for screen-estate logistics,&#xD;
    but can be used more purposefully to convey differences between “As-is” and “to-be” scenarios.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Inside the Canvas Workspace you have member management. The membership module allows for three different modes of&#xD;
    membership; Owner, Member &amp;amp; Moderator. The first tab provides an overview of the members, the next tab is for&#xD;
    invitation, and the last tab is information about the “owner” of this model. You can invite people of your&#xD;
    enterprise-network by looking them up from the Invite/share tab, or by entering the email-address.&#xD;
