    Business Model Innovation Leadership (BMIL)&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Model Innovation Leadership (BMIL): Defined as the strategically and proactively leadership of the business&#xD;
    BMs and BMI (“AS IS” and “TO BE” BM) in and into the core of the BMI process with the aim of gaining access, staying in&#xD;
    and gaining value of the BMI process to the business. The leadership act of strategic thinking and acting -&#xD;
    continuously thinking “out of the box” with respect to the specific BMI box, with the aim of reaching value and&#xD;
    advantage on behalf of BMI for the business. The value and advantage of the BMIL act can be very simple profit but also&#xD;
    other business values (please see D 3.2.), strategic advantage, competitive advantage and learning. These values and&#xD;
    advantage are very different from business to business, depending on and related to what the business want specifically&#xD;
    to get out of BMI and the BMI process. BMIL´s overall aim is to bring the business into a strategic advantage position&#xD;
    – e.g. in and into the core of the BMI process – where BMI is really taking place. BMIL aims at: 1. “ - increasing&#xD;
    strategically BMI capability and capacity by optimizing the business BMI investment via creating, excluding, keeping,&#xD;
    upgrading and diminishing value proposition offered, users and customers served, functions in the value chain&#xD;
    [internal] conducted, competences used, network used, relations and value formula used. The aim is to strategically to&#xD;
    improve existing BM´s position and strategically finding new positions for the BMs in the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    BMIL Canvas&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The BMIL canvas is developed to support BMIL related to both the creative and the implementation part of BMIL. In this&#xD;
    context we developed some sample questions related to each individual building block and each individual BMIL viewpoint&#xD;
    to support the process of BMIL. These are shown in paragraph17. The framework enables those responsible for BMIL to&#xD;
    address each of the 49 boxes in the BMIL canvas. By moving focus both vertical or horizontal in the BMIL canvas as&#xD;
    shown in the figure beneath we now have a possibility to find a creative and an “act do” way to any “AS IS” or “TO BE”&#xD;
    BM in any phase in a BMI process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 6: Vertical and horizontal questioning in the BMIL Canvas&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the vertical direction one would question each individual building block regarding one viewpoint (BMI Leadership&#xD;
    Line). In the horizontal direction one would change view point moving from e.g. a value innovation leadership view&#xD;
    point to a user and customer innovation leadership viewpoint and now ask from the customer innovation leadership side.&#xD;
    In this context the process can both be done with the aim of a “creative” (green arrow) (BM B and C) and an “act – do”&#xD;
    context (Red arrow) (BM A and D). The BMI process can both be carried out for “AS IS” - full square BMs - (BM A and BM&#xD;
    B)) and “TO BE BM” – other forms - BM´s (BM C and BM D) shown in the BMIL canvas beneath.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
