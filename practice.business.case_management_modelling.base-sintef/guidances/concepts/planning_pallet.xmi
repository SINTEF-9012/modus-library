    A planning pallet is a collection of plannable components that are available to a participant at runtime. Different&#xD;
    participants will see different versions/views of the pallet at different times depending upon their authority and the&#xD;
    context in which they are planning.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    When a planning task is planned at runtime, an instance is added to the plan. An instance of its contained “local&#xD;
    pallet” can be created as well. Such a pallet instance can be considered a case (instance) specific pallet, and can as&#xD;
    such be edited as well, though constraint rules in it might only be edited in design-time. The “global pallet” that&#xD;
    applies to the case can serve as constraint to what can be included in the case instance specific local pallets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    The name “planning pallet” is based on the metaphor of an artist pallet, containing a set of paints that the artist can&#xD;
    choose from and blend in order to create paintings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    Similarly a case worker can use a “pallet” of components, such as tasks, plan fragments and events, which can be used&#xD;
    to create or extend the “plan” of a case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    Planning is the act of creating or extending (adapting) the plan of a case. The plan is created and evolves in&#xD;
    “run-time”. Design time modeling is concerned with definition of plannable elements and their association with planning&#xD;
    pallets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    Components in the pallet can be tasks, plan fragments and events. It can be useful to also expose larger “spaces of&#xD;
    choice” to the case worker, such as folders (taxonomy nodes) of tasks, folders of plan fragments and folders of events.&#xD;
    The case worker can then select specific tasks, plan fragments and events from these folders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    A Planning pallet defines:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.35cm&quot;>&#xD;
            Which components can be planned (i.e. their instances can be added to the plan) for a cases of the case type.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.35cm&quot;>&#xD;
            Which phases of the case life cycle for which they can be planned.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.35cm&quot;>&#xD;
            Subject to which case-file based constraints.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.35cm&quot;>&#xD;
            Which case roles (“who”) are authorized to add them to a plan.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span lang=&quot;nb-NO&quot;>Pallets may be characterized as “global” and “local.” A global pallet contains all of the available&#xD;
    planning elements for a case type that may be used when planning is unrestricted. Typically this occurs with ad hoc&#xD;
    planning—planning initiated by a participant at runtime. A local pallet is restricted to those elements that can be&#xD;
    planned in a particular context. Typically this occurs when a planning task is encountered, and a participant is&#xD;
    required to perform planning at that time based on current circumstances of the case.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    Note that it will be common to share plannable components between planning pallets. Example: a plannable component that&#xD;
    is contained in the global pallet of a case (for ad-hoc) planning) can also be contained in a planning pallet of a&#xD;
    planning task (for planned planning).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm&quot;>&#xD;
    Planable components, in the global planning pallet of a case, can be meant for human-interactive “ad-hoc” planning. It&#xD;
    is also possible to include plan-able components that are meant for automatic planning. Example: when a case is&#xD;
    created, plan fragments are planned for the case and/or for one or more phases of the case.&#xD;
