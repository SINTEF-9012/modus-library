  <mainDescription>The EPC&amp;nbsp; metamodel is used to configure the structure and privacy of processes on a language based meta level. The&#xD;
executing instances are here exemplary applications and organisation units. The core element of the EPC concept is the&#xD;
flow, which is expressed with the flow element class. This element can be divided into events, which stand at the beginning&#xD;
and at the end of each process and the time consuming function element. The control of the process flow is ensured by&#xD;
connectors which follow a predicate logic. Between different functions or different processes messages can be exchanged.&#xD;
The flow between different processes is possible by the flow connection element. &lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this model is&amp;nbsp;to represent the structure of the processes.</purpose>
