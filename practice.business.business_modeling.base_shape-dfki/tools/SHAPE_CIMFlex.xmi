  <mainDescription>The CIMFlex tool provides a means for aiding domain experts with the documentation of their knowledge on the CIM-level in a&#xD;
set of models including data, organisational, business rules and process diagrams. Provided that, these CIM-level models&#xD;
are then transformed into the PIM-level models, thus transferring the domain expert knowledge on the technical level,&#xD;
allowing for further enrichment and amendments. At the same time, the models in BPMN notation can serve as a starting point&#xD;
for the further transformation to BPEL in order to provide the input for the execution engines.</mainDescription>
