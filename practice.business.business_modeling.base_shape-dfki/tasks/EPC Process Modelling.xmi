  <mainDescription>A business process is a sequence of actions carried out by different actors working together to deliver a tangible result&#xD;
and bring added business value to the company. A business process model generally describes the business and not the IT&#xD;
system. A business process is transversal, and is generally based on several structures and applications of one or several&#xD;
organizations. Business process descriptions bring real business vision&amp;nbsp;and constitute an excellent formalization and&#xD;
analysis tool when constructing systems. In the context of a development project&amp;nbsp;they are&amp;nbsp;used in&#xD;
business-oriented activities related to requirements, specifications and analysis.</mainDescription>
