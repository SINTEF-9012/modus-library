  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Planning Meeting is attended by the Product Owner, Scrum Master, the entire Scrum Team, and any interested&#xD;
    and appropriate management or customer representatives.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    During the sprint planning meeting the product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The team asks&#xD;
    enough questions during this meeting so that they can go off after the meeting and determine which tasks they will move&#xD;
    from the product backlog to the sprint backlog.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Collectively, the Scrum team and the product owner define a sprint goal, which is a short description of what the&#xD;
    sprint will attempt to achieve. The success of the sprint will later be assessed during the Sprint Review Meeting&#xD;
    against the sprint goal, rather than against each specific item selected from the product backlog.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    After the sprint planning meeting, the Scrum team meets separately to discuss what they heard and decide how much they&#xD;
    can commit to during the coming sprint. In some cases there will be negotiation with the product owner but it will&#xD;
    always be up to the team to determine how much they can commit to completing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The product owner doesn't have to describe every item being tracked on the product backlog. Depending on the size of the&#xD;
backlog and the speed of the team it may be sufficient to describe only the high priority items, saving the discussion of&#xD;
lower priority items for the next sprint planning meeting. Typically, the Scrum team will provide guidance when they start&#xD;
to get further into the backlog list than they know could be done in the next sprint.</keyConsiderations>
