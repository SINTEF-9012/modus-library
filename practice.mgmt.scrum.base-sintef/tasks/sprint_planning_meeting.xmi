    Sprint Planning Meeting&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning Meeting. This plan is created by the&#xD;
    collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is&#xD;
    proportionately shorter. For example, two-week Sprints have four-hour Sprint Planning Meetings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Planning Meeting consists of two parts, each one being a time-box of one half of the Sprint Planning Meeting&#xD;
    duration. The two parts of the Sprint Planning Meeting answer the following questions, respectively:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Part One: What will be done this Sprint?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this part, the Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The&#xD;
    Product Owner presents ordered Product Backlog items to the Development Team and the entire Scrum Team collaborates on&#xD;
    understanding the work of the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development&#xD;
    Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. The number of items selected from the Product&#xD;
    Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can&#xD;
    accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/workproducts/sprint_goal_C7293E60.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_6p8zUIcOEeKDAPAbcNl48A&quot;>Sprint Goal&lt;/a>. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint&#xD;
    through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is&#xD;
    building the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Part Two: How will the chosen work get done?&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having selected the work of the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done”&#xD;
    product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering&#xD;
    them is called the Sprint Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a&#xD;
    working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during the&#xD;
    Sprint Planning Meeting for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work&#xD;
    planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed to units of one day or less by the end&#xD;
    of this meeting. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during the&#xD;
    Sprint Planning Meeting and as needed throughout the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner may be present during the second part of the Sprint Planning Meeting to clarify the selected Product&#xD;
    Backlog items and to help make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it&#xD;
    may renegotiate the Sprint Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to&#xD;
    attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and&#xD;
    Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated&#xD;
    Increment.&#xD;
