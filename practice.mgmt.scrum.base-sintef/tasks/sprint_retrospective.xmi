    Sprint Retrospective&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to&#xD;
    be enacted during the next Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning Meeting. This is a&#xD;
    three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is allocated for shorter Sprints.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process framework, its development process and&#xD;
    practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team&#xD;
    plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/guidances/concepts/definition_of_done_B52B998F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_tprjYBCzEeGhfJHCQDJMKQ&quot;>Definition of &quot;Done&quot;&lt;/a> as appropriate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in&#xD;
    the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum&#xD;
    Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal&#xD;
    opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.&#xD;
