    Sprint Review&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.&#xD;
    During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that&#xD;
    and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done.&#xD;
    This is an informal meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster&#xD;
    collaboration.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is allocated for shorter&#xD;
    Sprints. For example, two week Sprints have two-hour Sprint Reviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Sprint Review includes the following elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner identifies what has been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems&#xD;
        were solved;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on&#xD;
        progress to date; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent&#xD;
        Sprint Planning Meetings.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the&#xD;
    next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.&#xD;
