  <mainDescription>On each day of a sprint, the team holds daily meetings (“the daily scrum”). Meetings are typically held in the same&#xD;
location and at the same time each day. Ideally the daily scrums are held in the morning as they help set the context for&#xD;
the coming day's work.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
All team members are required to attend the daily scrum. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson, or a&#xD;
developer from another project) is allowed to attend but is there only to listen. This makes the daily scrums an excellent&#xD;
way for a Scrum team to disseminate status information--if you're interested in hearing where things are at, attend that&#xD;
day's meeting.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The daily scrum is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and&#xD;
usually dealt with by the relevant sub-group immediately after the daily scrum. During the daily scrum each team member&#xD;
provides answers to the following three questions:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
1. What did you do yesterday?&lt;br />&#xD;
2. What will you do today?&lt;br />&#xD;
3. Are there any impediments in your way?&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today the team gains an excellent understanding&#xD;
of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum is not a status update meeting in which a boss is&#xD;
collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each&#xD;
other. If a programmer stands up and says &quot;Today I will finish the data storage module&quot; everyone knows that in tomorrow's&#xD;
meeting he will say whether or not he did finish. This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance&#xD;
of these commitments and that their commitments are to each other, not to some far-off customer or salesman.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical issues)&#xD;
he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is an old joke in which a chicken and a pig are talking and the chicken says, &quot;Let's start a restaurant.&quot; The pig&#xD;
    replies, &quot;Good idea, but what should we call it?&quot; &quot;How about 'Ham and Eggs'&quot; says the chicken. &quot;No thanks,&quot; says the&#xD;
    pig, &quot;I'd be committed, you'd only be involved.&quot; The joke is meant to point out the difference between those who are&#xD;
    committed on a project and those who are only involved. Scrum affords special status to those who are committed and&#xD;
    many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any impediments that are raised become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible. Typical&#xD;
    impediments are:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    * My ____ broke and I need a new one today.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I need help debugging a problem with ______.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I'm struggling to learn ______ and would like to pair with someone on it.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I can't get the ____ group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * The department VP has asked me to work on something else &quot;for a day or two.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
