    Daily Scrum&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan&#xD;
    for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that&#xD;
    could be done before the next one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting, each Development&#xD;
    Team member explains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What has been accomplished since the last meeting?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will be done before the next meeting?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What obstacles are in the way?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to assess progress toward the Sprint Goal and to assess how progress is&#xD;
    trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the&#xD;
    Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. The Development Team often meets immediately after the Daily Scrum to&#xD;
    re-plan the rest of the Sprint’s work. Every day, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner&#xD;
    and Scrum Master how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the goal and create the&#xD;
    anticipated Increment in the remainder of the Sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for&#xD;
    conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute&#xD;
    time-box.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum&#xD;
    is not a status meeting, and is for the people transforming the Product Backlog items into an Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify and remove impediments to development,&#xD;
    highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of project knowledge. This is a&#xD;
    key inspect and adapt meeting.&#xD;
