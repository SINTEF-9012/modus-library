  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition of &quot;done&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as &quot;Done&quot;, everyone must understand what &quot;Done&quot; means.&#xD;
    Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work&#xD;
    to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the &quot;Definition of Done&quot; for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when&#xD;
    work is complete on the product Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint&#xD;
    Planning Meeting. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that&#xD;
    adhere to the Scrum Teamâ€™s current Definition of &quot;Done.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is useable, so a Product&#xD;
    Owner may choose to immediately release it. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested,&#xD;
    ensuring that all Increments work together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their Definition of &quot;Done&quot; will expand to include more stringent criteria&#xD;
    for higher quality.&#xD;
