    Development Team&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of&#xD;
    &quot;Done&quot; product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting&#xD;
    synergy optimizes the Development Teamâ€™s overall efficiency and effectiveness. Development Teams have the following&#xD;
    characteristics:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog&#xD;
        into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being&#xD;
        performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to&#xD;
        the Development Team as a whole; and,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development Teams do not contain sub-teams dedicated to particular domains like testing or business analysis.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Development Team Size&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work. Fewer&#xD;
    than three Development Team members decreases interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller&#xD;
    Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to&#xD;
    deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large&#xD;
    Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage. The Product Owner and Scrum Master&#xD;
    roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.&#xD;
