    ARKTRANS is a Norwegian multimodal ITS framework architecture. It has been used as a base for modelling in the&#xD;
    transport domain for several transport and logistics projects both in Norway and the EU. The work in ARKTRANS has&#xD;
    defined a large set of roles and objects for the transport sector, as well as high-level generic use cases showing&#xD;
    relations between actors of the sector and functions that are performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
    Because of the complexity of the transport sector, the ARKTRANS reference model divides sector into five domains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
            The &lt;b>Transport Demand&lt;/b> domain supports transport preparation and planning, transport booking, and&#xD;
            follow-up for freight as well as passenger transport. The aim is to support the Transport User, which may be&#xD;
            both the party who wants to travel or to send goods and a third party who is organising the transport on behalf&#xD;
            of any Transport User (travel agency, forwarding agent, logistics provider).&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
            The &lt;b>Transport Service Management&lt;/b> domain addresses the management and provision of transport services to&#xD;
            the Transport Demand domain. Such services may for example be provided by transport companies or terminals. A&#xD;
            service may for example be transport along predefined and scheduled routes; ad hoc routes based on actual&#xD;
            demands; document handling services; and terminal services like loading, unloading and transhipment.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
            The &lt;b>On-board Support and Control&lt;/b> domain addresses navigation, the integration of Transport Modes and&#xD;
            Transportation Network Users in traffic operations, and safety issues related to the operation of the Transport&#xD;
            Means. Adaptation to traffic situation, traffic regulations, Transportation Network conditions, security and&#xD;
            efficiency are emphasized. On-board equipment provides information and supports safety during operation of the&#xD;
            Transport Means.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
            The &lt;b>Transport Sector Support&lt;/b> domain provides information and supportive services to the other parts of&#xD;
            the Reference Model shown in Figure 3. However, the services do not represent core transport or traffic&#xD;
            activities, as these are covered elsewhere in the Reference Model (e.g. transport service management). Several&#xD;
            types of services may be offered to the other domains.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
            The &lt;b>Transportation Network Management&lt;/b> domain addresses the infrastructure provided by roads, fairways,&#xD;
            railways, air corridors and Transfer Nodes. A Transfer Node is in this context a location or area where goods&#xD;
            and passengers enter, leave or transfer between Transport Means. The Transportation Network arrange for&#xD;
            mobility in general. The Transportation Network Management domain is further divided into four sub-domains,&#xD;
            Transportation Network Infrastructure Management, Transportation Network Utilisation, Regulation Enforcement,&#xD;
            and Emergency Management&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
    The reference model is shown in the figure .&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/arktrans.png&quot; width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;268&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;>&#xD;
    The framework architecture, as well as the extensive work on identification and classification of the roles in the&#xD;
    transport sector can be used as a way of categorizing the use cases and classification of the actors involved in the&#xD;
    cases.&#xD;
