&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Manure Producer&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is usually a livestock farmer who has an excess of Manure and wants to get rid of it. For the transportation of&#xD;
    the Manure he has a full service contract with a Manure Transporter. This means that all the work that comes with the&#xD;
    Manure transportation is done by the Manure Transporter, e.g. search for a Manure Consumer and the mandatory&#xD;
    ‘paperwork’.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Producer gets a digital copy of this ‘paperwork’. The Manure Producer pays the Manure Transporter for the&#xD;
    transportation cost, the removal of the Manure and the administrative work around the transport.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A typical farmer will request a tanker once a week. It is up to the manure producer to assess the levels of manure&#xD;
    accumulating and then book a tanker visit at the appropriate time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Manure Transporter&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a transportation company which transports the manure from the Manure Producer to the Manure Consumer and takes&#xD;
    care of all regulatory proceeding and ‘paperwork’. This Manure Transporter is the customer in the AGR BM.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Transporter has contracts with both Manure Providers and Manure Consumers. Upon a manure transportation&#xD;
    request the Manure Transporter dispatches a truck with tank trailer to the Manure Provider to load the manure. During&#xD;
    this process, samples are taken from the loaded manure into sealable bags. These sealed bags are fitted with a unique&#xD;
    serial number barcode and scanned by the Sampling Unit. This data together with GPS and other sensor data are sent via&#xD;
    the Infrastructure Provider to the Authority which acknowledges the data received.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When loading is complete, the manure is transported to the Manure Consumer. The Manure Producer gets an invoice of the&#xD;
    ‘transportation’ cost. Next a consumer must be found. This is done by using Manure Administration data together with&#xD;
    GPS coordination to determine the closest consumer location. The consumer determines, based on actual and/or historical&#xD;
    soil quality data of his land, if he wants to receive the manure or not. A manure consumer may indicate preferences for&#xD;
    particular manure producers and may also indicate manure producers from who he does not wish to receive deliveries.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the unloading at the consumer site, optional additional samples can be taken, e.g. because of something went&#xD;
    wrong at the sampling process during loading.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The unloading data is sent via the Infrastructure Provider to the Authority. The manure sample sealed bags are sent by&#xD;
    the Manure Transporter to the Laboratory for examination. The Manure Consumer is paid.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the administration of all the manure administration the Manure Transporter has a contract with a Manure&#xD;
    Administrator.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Who is the provider of the ground quality data? How is ground quality measured? Is the relevant soil quality measure&#xD;
    relevant to the value analysis?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Manure Consumer&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is usually an arable farmer who can use the Manure as fertilizer for his land. For the consumption of Manure he&#xD;
    has a full service contract with the Manure Transporter. This means that all the work that comes with the Manure&#xD;
    transportation is done by the Manure Transporter, e.g. mandatory ‘paperwork’.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Consumer gets a digital copy of this ‘paperwork’. The Manure Consumer receives a fee for the amount of&#xD;
    Manure consumed, minus a deduction for the administrative work and transport cost, both of which are fully itemised on&#xD;
    the paperwork.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Infrastructure Provider&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is fulfilled by Vlastuin. The Infrastructure Provider holds a redundant IT server stack which is the centre&#xD;
    of all communication around manure transporting. It receives data from the AGR-Unit on a tank trailer of a Manure&#xD;
    Transporter and stores this data on the server.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a loading or unloading report is sent, the server immediately separates mandatory data for the Authority and sends&#xD;
    it to them. If everything is received fine a confirmation is received which is forwarded to the AGR-Unit informing the&#xD;
    operator that the loading or unloading job has completed. The server is also connected to the Manure Administrator&#xD;
    which means all laboratory results in the manure administration are accessible via this route.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Transporter can access all this data via a personal AGR website. This website can give him insight in&#xD;
    transport movement (Track-and-Trace) and custumer specific manure accounting data. Besides this, the Infrastructure&#xD;
    provider (Vlastuin) also sells the products D-TEC Manure Sampling Unit and the AGR-Unit to the Manure Transporter.&#xD;
    These products automatically have a D-TEC/AGR servicing contract, i.e., servicing of the Sampling Unit, continuous&#xD;
    firmware updates of the AGR-Unit and software updates of the AGR website. The mobile data connection for the AGR-Unit&#xD;
    to the server stack is also provided by the Infrastructure Provider.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Lastly, the Infrastructure Provider sells consumables and spare parts for the Sampling Unit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Infrastructure Provider uses the specific administrative services of the Manure Administrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Manure Administrator&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This organisation, VDM Admin, provides specific administrative services to meet the requirements of the Fertilizer Law,&#xD;
    e.g. the application of a Manure Accounting ID from the Ministry. The accounting ID is used in all relevant&#xD;
    transactions. Each manure transport has it own unique ID, all data (load/unload data, sealable bag barcode, laboratory&#xD;
    result, etc) is linked to this ID, which in turn, is linked to the ID of the Manure Account of the producer and&#xD;
    consumer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Manure Administrator also receives the Laboratory results of the Manure Samples and feeds this data into the Manure&#xD;
    Administration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Laboratory&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Laboratory receives the Manure Sample seal bags from the Manure Transporter, identifies the Manure Provider or&#xD;
    Manure Consumer by the sealable bag barcode, determines the values of the predefined measures of substances in the&#xD;
    Manure and send this back to the Manure Administrator and the Authority.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the measures sub-section below, it has been assumed that the ammonium level is the most important element to take&#xD;
    account of, however there may be other nutrients which are important to measure. In general the higher the level of&#xD;
    ammonium the better the manure. There is no point however in injecting soil beyond the level of benefit which is being&#xD;
    sought.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are also regulatory requirements which may dictate the maximum amount of certain pollutants which are allowable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Authority&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Authority is the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries. They determine the Law and Regulation.&#xD;
    The Application Department of this Ministry receives the Manure Transporting data and Laboratory Results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Regulator&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Regulator is charged with the enforcement of the law and regulations, created by the Authority. This is the AID&#xD;
    (Dutch for General Inspection Service) in the Netherlands. They visit every party in the AGR BM to determine if&#xD;
    everything goes by the rules. Besides this they also check the Farmers: Manure Administration, Animal welfare, and&#xD;
    farmland pollution. If something is not OK, the organisation gets a fine.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One aspect of the regulatory environment is that a manure transporter can be subject to on-the-spot checks at any time&#xD;
    in the carriage of manure from producer to consumer.&#xD;
