  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the VDML ontology diagram in Figure 91 highlights, roles, based on their collaboration with each other, provide&#xD;
    and/or receive value propositions. Value propositions articulate values. A value proposition is “an expression of the&#xD;
    values offered to a recipient in terms of the recipient’s level of satisfaction”. In VDML “value” is defined as “a&#xD;
    measurable benefit delivered to a recipient in association with a business item”. Any value should be identifiable and&#xD;
    measurable, either objectively or subjectively. A value may have an objective measure, whereas the measure of the&#xD;
    recipient’s level of satisfaction is subjective. Though values need not be intrinsic in a deliverable, but may often&#xD;
    relate to a transaction, a relationship, a corporate “image” or reputation, etc., values are not actually received by&#xD;
    recipients when there is no deliverable (or business item) exchanged whatsoever. Delivery of business items is the&#xD;
    basis of exchanging values. Note again that deliverables need not be tangible. They are often intangible. Many values&#xD;
    maybe associated with intangibles. As discussed in 3.1.4, roles perform activity. Activities create and consume value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
