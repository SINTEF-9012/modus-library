  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units are the building blocks to define the more formal and structured parts of organizations. An&#xD;
    organization can be defined as “an administrative or functional structure normally interpreted as a network of&#xD;
    organization units at a higher level in an organizational hierarchy”. An organization unit is “an administrative or&#xD;
    functional organizational collaboration, with responsibility for defined resources, including a collaboration that&#xD;
    occurs in the typical organization hierarchy, such as business units and departments (and also the company itself), as&#xD;
    well as less formal organizational collaboration such as a committee, project, or task force”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organization units provide capabilities. A capability is “the ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver&#xD;
    desired value”. We will discuss about value later, but analyze capabilities in more detail first. Organization units&#xD;
    that provide capabilities do need capability methods and/or resources to support these capabilities. The same or&#xD;
    different organization units own these. A resource is “anything that is used or consumed in the production of a&#xD;
    deliverable”. A capability method is “a reusable template for a collaboration configured for participants to perform&#xD;
    activities to deliver a capability and to contribute value in a particular situation”. We will discuss about activities&#xD;
    later. Both organization units and capability methods are collaborations of roles. As will be discussed later,&#xD;
    capability methods, especially the more structured ones, are a perfect basis for process discovery. In particular,&#xD;
    process definitions that comply with the BPMN standard (see BPMN (2011)), can be generated from capability methods&#xD;
    (model transformation).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
