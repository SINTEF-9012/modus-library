    VDML specializes collaboration into a few common sub-types. Figure 12 highlights two of them: “community” and “business&#xD;
    network”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Figure 12. VDML high-level ontology: Collaboration highlighted&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    A business network is “a collaboration between independent business (or economic) entities, potentially companies,&#xD;
    agencies, individuals or anonymous members of communities of independent business entities, participating in an&#xD;
    economic exchange”. A business network defines a business collaboration of roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A community is “a collaboration of participants with similar interests that work together for some shared purpose such&#xD;
    as sharing knowledge”. A community defines an informal or “weak” collaboration of roles. The collaboration that a&#xD;
    community represents is said to be “informal” and “weak”, as opposed to collaboration in the formal and structured part&#xD;
    of the organization, as defined by organization units. Organization units (or org units) will be discussed later. We&#xD;
    will revisit communities later, and will first focus discussion on business networks.&#xD;
