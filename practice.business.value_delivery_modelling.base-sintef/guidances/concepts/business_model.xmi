  <mainDescription>A business model is an abstraction of a business/enterprise that expresses the fundamental operation of the business from a&#xD;
stakeholder perspective. There are several types of business model that involve relationships between “business model&#xD;
building blocks.” This specification does not adopt a particular type, but defines a set of elements that can be extended&#xD;
for representation of the building blocks of a particular type as determined by the VDML user.</mainDescription>
