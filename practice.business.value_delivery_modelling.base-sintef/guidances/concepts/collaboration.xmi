  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A collaboration defines a set of roles that collaborate for a particular purpose or to generate a specific value&#xD;
    proposition or outcome.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Actors, such as persons, can participate in roles. A collaboration as a unit may receive or provide value to others&#xD;
    through collaborations in which it participates. So a role of one kind of collaboration can fill a role of another&#xD;
    collaboration, such as an employee role in a company can fill a manager role in a department. Role dependencies can&#xD;
    also be defined, for example participation in the employee role is a requirement for the participant to also fill the&#xD;
    manager role. Collaborations can participate in roles within other collaborations. For example, a contracts team (a&#xD;
    collaboration) participates in the Contract manager role on a larger Project Team (also a collaboration).&lt;br />&#xD;
    When no participant is defined in a role, the role is said to be vacant.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Participants in roles within collaborations, can be said to provide value that contributes to the collaboration. When&#xD;
    participants, via roles, collaborate, each of them is providing value to others through the roles that they play, and&#xD;
    may receive value back in turn. Participants “contribute” value, but also gain value “in return” as well. Values that&#xD;
    roles provide can be defined through value propositions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborations may have goals (or milestones) defined. Goals relate to deliverables.&lt;br />&#xD;
