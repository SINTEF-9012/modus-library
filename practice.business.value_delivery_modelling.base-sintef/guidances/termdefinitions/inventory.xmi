  <mainDescription>Inventory represents a buffer of deliverables waiting for consumption by the target activity of the associated value chain&#xD;
flow. Inventories typically occur as a result of batch operations that reduce the cost per unit of setup time. An implicit&#xD;
inventory may occur as a result of deliverables in transit. Inventories may also incur cost for storage and investment, and&#xD;
inventories may contain obsolete deliverables if the deliverable specifications change. An inventory may shorten customer&#xD;
order delivery time by satisfying orders from stock rather than production for individual orders, and int may introduce&#xD;
delay due to batch scheduling practices.</mainDescription>
