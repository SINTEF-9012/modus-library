  <mainDescription>An activity port represents the connection between an deliverable flow and an activity. This allows for links within an&#xD;
activity to be associated with specific inputs and outputs that may occur at different times during the performance of an&#xD;
activity. It also allows for specification of the nature of the consumption of deliverables such as consumption of 4 wheels&#xD;
for one car where computation of the cost of the car must include the cost of 4 wheels.</mainDescription>
