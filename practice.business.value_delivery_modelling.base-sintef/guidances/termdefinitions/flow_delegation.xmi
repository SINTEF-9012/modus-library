  <mainDescription>Represents a deliverable flow into or out of a collaboration that is a flow into or out of an activity within the&#xD;
collaboration. This provides the linkage between activities within a collaboration and a role of the collaboration as a&#xD;
participant in a “parent” collaboration. &#xD;

    Flow delegation is semantically equivalent to delegation of two ports that are connected via a deliverable flow. Rather&#xD;
    than delegating both ports, it is sometimes useful to delegate the deliverable flow itself. The delegated flow connects&#xD;
    ports which might be contained in the same “child” collaboration, but might also be contained in different “child”&#xD;
    collaborations. In the latter case, there is a “parent” collaboration (directly or indirectly), in which both “child”&#xD;
    collaborations participate in roles.&#xD;
