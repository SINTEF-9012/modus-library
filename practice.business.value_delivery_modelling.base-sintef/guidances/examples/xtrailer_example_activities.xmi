    XTrailer: Activities&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We now revisit the XTrailer business network collaboration. Its role collaboration view, or “value network” view was&#xD;
    already represented by the model view mockup in Figure 13. Figure 42 provides a model view mockup of its activity&#xD;
    network.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 42. Business network’s activity network mockup&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Note that both the role collaboration view, and the activity network view are views on the same underlying model.&#xD;
    Figure 43 combines both the view in one picture, for convenience and ease of recognition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Figure 43. Business network: role collaboration versus activity network&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Roles, in one view represented as ovals, in the other as swim lanes, are the same. Four out of five deliverable flows&#xD;
    exposed in both views. The activity network view is providing detail that is abstracted away in the role collaboration&#xD;
    view. These details are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Activities of the business network. Note that business networks, as any collaboration, can contain activities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stores that are owned by the organization that fills the Manufacturer party role. Though the Idea flow into the&#xD;
        Ideas store, and the Order flow into the Orders store are shown in the role collaboration view, the stores&#xD;
        themselves aren’t. These store inputs are “handled” under the responsibility of the Manufacturer role in the&#xD;
        business network collaboration. The Ideas store is owned by R&amp;amp;D and the Orders store by S&amp;amp;D, both being&#xD;
        organization units that are part of MyCompany.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The deliverable flow of Order, from the Orders store to the Manage Fulfillment activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Two activities, “Manage Innovation” and “Manage fulfillment”, are represented by a rectangle shape that contains an&#xD;
    “expansion button” (a small box with “+” sign in it), in Figure 42. These activities “delegate” their work to another&#xD;
    collaboration, as will be discussed below. Basically these activities represent the use of sub-collaborations, in the&#xD;
    context of the business network collaboration.&#xD;
