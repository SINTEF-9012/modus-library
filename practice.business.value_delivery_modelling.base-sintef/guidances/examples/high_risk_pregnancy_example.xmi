&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Value Proposition Exchange&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 12 below depicts the business party roles of a Client (the patient as an economic entity), a Doctor’s Office (a&#xD;
    business entity that includes one or more doctors, supporting staff and facilities), and a Hospital. In the normal&#xD;
    course of business, these parties exchange products and services expressed as value propositions related to healthcare.&#xD;
    The ovals represent business party roles and the hexagons represent value propositions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Value Proposition Exchange for the Maternity Care Value Stream&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 13 below depicts the roles and value propositions of interest to this use case. The Hospital management wants to&#xD;
    understand the impact of remote monitoring on the value proposition delivered to the patient. To perform this analysis,&#xD;
    the analyst must consider the value stream that supports the value proposition to the Client. A value stream consists&#xD;
    of the activities, the capabilities, the deliverables and the values that contribute to the value proposition. In other&#xD;
    words, a value proposition defines a value stream by virtue of the linkages of the VDML model that identify the&#xD;
    activities, capabilities, values and deliverables that contribute to the value proposition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Maternity Care Role Collaboration Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 14 below illustrates the role collaboration view of the maternity care value stream showing the exchange of&#xD;
    high-level deliverables between the business entity roles of the business network that are relevant to this use&#xD;
    case.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_14.png&quot; width=&quot;484&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 14: Maternity Care Role Collaboration Diagram&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Maternity Care Business Network Activity Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 15 below shows an activity network view of the maternity care business network. This network depicts the&#xD;
    activities of the business network parties that accomplish the associated exchange of deliverables and value&#xD;
    propositions. The rows of the activity diagram represent the roles of the business network. The activities of a role&#xD;
    are performed by a participant in that role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The boxes with rounded corners are activities and the inverted pyramids are stores. A store receives and holds business&#xD;
    items until they are needed by a subsequent activity. The diamond elements on the activities indicate alternative&#xD;
    deliverable outputs, so a patient may either leave a doctor’s office visit with a repeat appointment or be admitted to&#xD;
    the hospital. The plus-sign icon indicates that the activity delegates to a capability method for the detail of the&#xD;
    work to be done. The client performs one activity that either makes a doctor’s appointment to enter the healthcare&#xD;
    system as a patient in the Doctor’s office, or the client enters the system as a hospital emergency patient. The other&#xD;
    roles, Doctor’s Office and Hospital, perform activities that delegate to more detailed capability methods.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_15.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Doctor's Office Role Collaboration Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 16 below shows a role collaboration diagram. The ovals represent roles and the arrows represent the flow of&#xD;
    deliverables. This view makes it easier to see the inputs and outputs of each role. The analyst can consider if it is&#xD;
    reasonable for additional deliverables to be exchanged or if some of the work calls for additional roles. The analyst&#xD;
    may add intangible deliverables to the table and the diagram where needed as a result of this analysis. An intangible&#xD;
    deliverable is one that is not formally recognized but is needed for effective operation. Often these are&#xD;
    conversations, telephone calls and emails.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_16.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 16: Doctor's Office Role Collaboration Diagram&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Capability methods delegations&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
Figure 17 below depicts the delegation paths for the capability methods of this use case. The top-level corresponds to the&#xD;
roles of the maternity care business network of Figure 16. The next level corresponds to the methods engaged by activities&#xD;
of the business network roles. Only one activity is specified for the Client and that activity does not delegate. Each of&#xD;
the activities of the Doctor’s Office and Hospital delegate to a method that defines the detail of that activity. Two of&#xD;
these (the Doctor’s office visit, and the Hospital maternity care methods) further delegate to additional methods. The&#xD;
methods identified with an asterisk (*), above, are used as examples in the following discussion.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Visit Doctor's Office Capability Method&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 18 below illustrates the Doctor’s Office visit method. Patient appointments are held in a store pending arrival&#xD;
    of the patient at the designated time. At the end of the visit, the patient either makes another appointment (the&#xD;
    Patient Appointments store) or the obstetrician makes a hospital admission request (a store for Hospital Admission).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_18.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Monitoring Initiation Capability Method&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 19 above illustrates the capability method for the Monitoring Initiation method. The bottom-left pyramids&#xD;
    indicate where the collaboration activity network is entered and exited by delegation and where delegation of&#xD;
    deliverable inputs and outputs occurs. The monitor provider role of this capability method performs several activities&#xD;
    with the patient as the input and output business item. This progression of the same business item is common in&#xD;
    manufacturing operations where the same business item is enhanced in stages. The result of this capability method is&#xD;
    that the patient leaves with a monitoring device installed and tested, with an understanding from instructions and as a&#xD;
    patient being monitored. The initiation of monitoring adds to the store of Patients Monitored. Monitoring is a&#xD;
    capability not further elaborated in this use case but is engaged by the Gestation Monitoring capability method, below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_19.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 19: Monitoring Initiation Capability Method&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gestation Monitoring Method&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 20 below depicts the Gestation Monitoring capability method that is a result of the remote monitoring&#xD;
    capability. Patients who are not monitored will just use repeated office visits for evaluation of the status of their&#xD;
    pregnancy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/hrp_figure_20.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 20: Gestation Monitoring Method&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Hospital Maternity Care Method&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 21 below illustrates the capability method for hospital maternity care. This method is engaged by delegation&#xD;
    from the hospital maternity care activity in the business network, but it does not receive its inputs from the&#xD;
    delegating activity. Instead, it receives patients for admission in its Hospital Admission Requests store. Similarly,&#xD;
    the capability methods engaged by these activities receive their inputs into stores, and deliver their outputs to&#xD;
    stores.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hrp_figure_21.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;136&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 21: Hospital Maternity Care Method&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Clinical Capability Management Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 22 below depicts an example capability management diagram for some of the capabilities of the high-risk&#xD;
    pregnancy use case. It shows the organization units and the community responsible for providing certain specialist&#xD;
    physician capability offers, using capability methods and managing capability methods and resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hrp_figure_22.png&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 22: Clinical Capability Management Diagram&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    An Organization Structure in a Collaboration Structure Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The analyst can navigate from the capability management diagram (Figure 22) to an organization structure diagram like&#xD;
    that in Figure 23, to locate the organization units and their management chains. Figure 23 uses a collaboration&#xD;
    structure diagram to represent an organization structure. In an organization structure, organization unit&#xD;
    collaborations are assigned to position roles in other organization unit collaborations—thus representing the&#xD;
    organization hierarchy.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hrp_figure_23.png&quot; width=&quot;494&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Measurement Dependency Graph&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A measurement dependency graph like that in Figure 24 can be generated from the activity network and activity value&#xD;
    contributions. The plus (+) and minus (-) signs on the arcs indicate if the source measurement increases or decreases&#xD;
    the target measurement. The graph depicts the aggregations of value contribution measurements that determine&#xD;
    satisfaction levels and the overall patient satisfaction of the value proposition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hrp_figure_24.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 24: Measurement Dependency Graph&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Capability Map&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 25 below illustrates a capability map display that can be generated from a capability library. The analyst can&#xD;
    highlight certain capabilities in the capability map (boxes shown with double borders) that should be targeted for&#xD;
    improvement to provide a capability “heat map” for management presentations. The analyst can then navigate from the&#xD;
    capabilities of the heat map to the capability management diagrams (e.g., Figure 25) and associated organization units.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/hrp_figure_25.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
