    XTrailer: Business network and collaboration&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 13 provides a model view mockup of the simple business network in the XTrailer use case example. This notation&#xD;
    is compliant with the value network notation as introduced by Allee (2008).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    It represents collaboration between two parties, indicated by the ovals: the manufacturer and the transporter. Parties&#xD;
    are specialized roles. Roles in business network are “parties”. Collaboration between Manufacturer and Transporter is&#xD;
    represented by their exchange of deliverables, via deliverable flows, depicted by the connectors. Solid connectors&#xD;
    denote flows of tangibles. Dashed connectors denote flows of intangibles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A deliverable flow is defined as &quot;a transfer of a deliverable from a provider (or producer) to a recipient (or&#xD;
    consumer)&quot;. A tangible is “a deliverable that represents something that is contracted, mandated or expected by the&#xD;
    recipient and which may generate revenue”. In the example, Order and Product are tangibles. In the context of the&#xD;
    XTrailer use case, Order can be taken as trailer order and Product as a trailer. An intangible is “a deliverable that&#xD;
    represents something that is unpaid or non-contractual that makes things work smoothly or efficiently”. In the example,&#xD;
    Idea and Innovation are intangibles. Transporters provide feedback to the manufacturer, in the form of ideas. The&#xD;
    manufacturer works ideas into innovations of the product, provided to the transporters. These go beyond what is&#xD;
    expected or contracted.&#xD;
