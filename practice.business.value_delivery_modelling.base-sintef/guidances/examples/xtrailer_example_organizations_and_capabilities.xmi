    XTrailer: Organizations and capabilities&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 25 shows the model view mockup of the structure of the MyCompany organization. As an organization unit by&#xD;
    itself, it consists of three other organization units: R&amp;amp;D, Trailer Plant and S&amp;amp;D, being assigned the position&#xD;
    roles Department1, Plant1 and Department2 in MyCompany respectively. R&amp;amp;D is responsible for research and&#xD;
    development, Trailer Plant for the actual production of the trailers, and S&amp;amp;D for sales and delivery.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 25. Organization structure mockup&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As indicated in the conceptual diagram in Figure 28, distinction is made between capabilities and capability offers. An&#xD;
    organization unit that provides a capability is actually having a capability offer for that capability. The name&#xD;
    “capability” is reserved for types of capabilities that are maintained in a capability library. A capability library&#xD;
    contains a taxonomy of capabilities, consisting of capability definitions and categories of them, and is applied to&#xD;
    enforce consistency in the definition of capabilities. Multiple capability offers that are associated with the same&#xD;
    capability, are considered similar from the perspective of the library. Such libraries might be industry-standard,&#xD;
    company-standard, but might also be specific to a particular modeling effort. A capability offer represents “the&#xD;
    ability to perform a particular kind of work and deliver desired value, by applying resources that are managed&#xD;
    together, possibly based on formalized methods”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vdml_figure28.png&quot; width=&quot;309&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 28. Capability management&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    As Figure 28 also indicates, a capability method that supports a capability offer might be owned by the same&#xD;
    organization unit that also provides the capability offer, but might also be owned by a different organization unit,&#xD;
    e.g. in case a certain method is enforced on multiple organization units, all providing their capability offer, for the&#xD;
    same capability. In the XTrailer use case example we will only consider the situation in which an organization unit&#xD;
    that uses a capability method to support its capability offer, also owns that method. The model view mockup in Figure&#xD;
    29 shows the capability library that is used in the XTrailer use case example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Figure 29. Capability library mockup&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 33 provides a model view mockup of the R&amp;amp;D organization unit, together with its capability offers that it&#xD;
    provides (the hexagons on the R&amp;amp;D boundary), the capability methods that support these capability offers (the&#xD;
    rectangles with activity-flow marker, inside the R&amp;amp;D boundary) and the resource stores and pools that support the&#xD;
    capability offers (the triangles without marker and the ones with re-use marker respectively). Dotted lines indicate&#xD;
    how a capability method that supports one capability offer can depend on other capability offers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
