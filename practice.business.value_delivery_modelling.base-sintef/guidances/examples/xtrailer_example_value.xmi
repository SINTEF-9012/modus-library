    XTrailer: Value&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Figure 92 shows mockups of the XTrailer business network collaboration. The expanded view, being the actual role&#xD;
    collaboration view, has been considered earlier. It shows how party roles exchange deliverables.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 92. Business network: role collaboration view and proposition exchange view mockups&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    In collapsed view it just shows how party roles exchange value propositions. Of the two value propositions in Figure&#xD;
    92, we will analyze the XTrailer Proposition, provided by the manufacturer and received by the transporter, in detail.&#xD;
    Later on we will briefly consider the value proposition that the transporter provides to the manufacturer in&#xD;
    return.&lt;br />&#xD;
    As will be discussed in more detail below, a value proposition articulates values, defined as “value add” elements that&#xD;
    are related to the output ports to which the deliverable flows connect. This will enable “toggling” between the two&#xD;
    views in Figure 92.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objects in the proposition exchange view mockup in Figure 92, that define the exchange of the XTrailer Proposition.&#xD;
    The value proposition, as well as the two party roles in the business network, one of which is the provider of the&#xD;
    value proposition, and the other being the recipient.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the XTrailer use case we assume that the Transporter cares about the following four values:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fair Price. This relates to the price that transporters has to pay for a trailer. This value is measured based on&#xD;
        the measure of product price.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Market driven design. This is about the extent to which innovation (design and development of trailers) is driven&#xD;
        by feedback from the transporters. This value is measured based on the measure of idea productization, i.e. the&#xD;
        ratio of ideas that make it to new products, relative to all ideas that have been received.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fast innovation. This is about the time it takes to translate transporter’s feedback into new trailers that are&#xD;
        available on the market. This value is measured based on the measure of innovation lead time, which is the time&#xD;
        ideas reside in the ideas store(s), plus the duration of Manage Idea activity, plus the duration of the Release&#xD;
        Management method.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Late spec freeze. This is about how flexible a transporter is in making changes to the specification of trailers&#xD;
        that are ordered. The shorter time it takes to actually produce a trailer, the more flexible the transporter is in&#xD;
        making changes to the order, as the specification of the order is “frozen” at the moment the production starts.&#xD;
        Hence this value is measured based on the measure of product lead time, which is the duration of the Build Product&#xD;
        activity, plus the time a trailer resides in the Products store, plus the duration of the Deliver Product activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As indicated in the model view mockup in Figure 94, the value proposition “XTrailer Proposition” consists of four&#xD;
    components, one for each of these four values.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/vdml_figure94.png&quot; width=&quot;427&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 94. Value proposition components mockup&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
    Note that, though this mockup is more indicative than “actual”, it suggests that an appropriate view on a value&#xD;
    proposition may also have the quality of “dashboard”, with drill down to underlying details. Measurement of the&#xD;
    “underlying” value, as well as of the level of satisfaction of the recipient with that value, will be analyzed in&#xD;
    detail below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The mockup diagram in Figure 95 provides a more complete representation of the value proposition in tabular form.&#xD;
