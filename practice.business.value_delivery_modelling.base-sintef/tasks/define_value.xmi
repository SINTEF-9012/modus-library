    There are different ways to measure the “gain” (or lack of it) in a business network (or “business model”). The&#xD;
    metamodel diagram of Business Networks in Figure 15 defines two measured characteristics, to measure “gain” per party:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Profit. Above we discussed modeling and measurement of profit. A profit is realized when the price that the&#xD;
        recipient pays is higher than the provider’s cost.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Value margin. Value margin is the margin that the recipient party in a business network might realize and can be&#xD;
        defined as the difference between proposition value of value propositions received, and “fair market value”, or as&#xD;
        the difference between proposition value and the price that is paid to providers (providing parties in the same&#xD;
        business network) of the corresponding value propositions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Profit is defined from the perspective of the provider of a value proposition. Value margin is defined from the&#xD;
    perspective of the recipient of it. Profit alone is not a sufficient indicator for healthiness of the business network&#xD;
    (“business model”). It is possible that a party realizes profit, but is observing a negative value margin. For&#xD;
    instance, when the recipient of the value proposition associates “equivalent economic value” to a value proposition,&#xD;
    lower than the “fair market price”, or in other words: when the recipient party judges price to pay as higher than the&#xD;
    value it receives.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Measurement of value margin requires that proposition value is measured in economic (monetary) terms. The VDML&#xD;
    metamodel supports modeling of such custom measured characteristics of measureable elements, such as value proposition,&#xD;
    value proposition component, business item and store.&#xD;
