  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to VDML modelling collaboration is fundamental to modelling business systems. The essence of what is going on&#xD;
    in business is “collaboration”. Value is created through collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    VDML defines a collaboration as a “collection of participants working together for a shared purpose”, whereby a&#xD;
    participant is defined as “anyone or anything that can fill a role in a collaboration”. Participants can be actors&#xD;
    (human or automatons) or collaborations by themselves, or roles of actors or collaborations. An actor is “an individual&#xD;
    (indivisible) participant, which might be human (a person) or non human (e.g. a software agent or machine)”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Basically a business system is constructed as a collaboration of collaborations. An entire enterprise or business&#xD;
    network is a collaboration, and so is any team, project, process, taskforce, etc. VDML also provides the means to align&#xD;
    collaborations with each other and to construct collaborations from other collaborations and individuals (actors).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Participants participate in a collaboration, and as such, collaborate, through roles. Each collaboration defines and&#xD;
    contains a set of roles, a role being “an expected behavior pattern or capability profile associated with participation&#xD;
    in a collaboration”. Roles define what is expected from participants, and what they have to perform, in the specific&#xD;
    context of a collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of role introduces the term “capability”. Capability expectations of roles come from capability&#xD;
    requirements of activities that roles have to perform in collaborations.&#xD;
