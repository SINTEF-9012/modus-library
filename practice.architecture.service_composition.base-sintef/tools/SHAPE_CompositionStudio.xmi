  <mainDescription>The Composition Studio creates models of service compositions with help of a visual model-based editor based on UML&#xD;
activity dia-grams. The goal of this task is to be able to generate executable code that can be deployed on an execution&#xD;
platform. We will specifically look into BPEL as the execution platform. Also the relation with high-level business&#xD;
modeling such as UML Activity Diagrams is supported in order to facilitate code generation from such high levels of&#xD;
abstraction.</mainDescription>
