Depending on the functionality to use, the service operation to call will be different.

In this task the final selection of services is done having in mind those issues and the composition design is completed with the information to bind the services to be used. The result will be the Service Deployment Architecture with the functional requirements fulfilled. It is the composition design completed with information about how to implement it. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P></purpose>
