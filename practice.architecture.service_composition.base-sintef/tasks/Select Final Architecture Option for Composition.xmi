In later phases, development team will be able to decide if they will follow the architecture labelled as the best one, or other similar alternative with less development cost, for example. The result will be all the architectural options, patterns and policies arranged in ranking which will be an important input for the “Design Time Services Composition” phase.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P></mainDescription>

Think in all the important aspects for each project, specially the quality-cost relationship. A knowledge base may include results applying some of the alternatives which could be useful to see if the architectural solutions are as good as they are supposed to be. Use all the information available to give a total score to each alternative.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;

This is because some architectural options which seem to be very good, offer less performance to certain problems or have a cost which is not justifiable comparing it with other alternatives. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P></sectionDescription>
