This means that the steps to be followed during the execution of the composition are going to be defined, pointing out what to do and in which order. &lt;/SPAN>&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US&quot;>As a result a UML activity and/or sequence diagram with the design of the workflow is obtained. In one hand, the activity diagram can show the flow to be followed, the conditions, parallel functionalities, etc. In the other hand, the sequence diagram can show the order of execution and the data interchange between functional slices. Another alternative is to use specific notations, like BPDM or BPMN, designed to represent all the composition aspects in a graphical way. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/P>&#xD;

Analyse if there are more functional parts which do not appear directly in the system requirements, but are necessary or can be deducted. This activity was almost done in the process explained before, obtaining a list of abstract services. So SSM is a basic input because it contains the abstract services to be used in the composition. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P>&#xD;

Try to obtain functional slices which can be performed by those services, to improve the composition (use trustable services, a service could be modified to fulfil better the requirements…) and increase the profit. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P></sectionDescription>

This is an important issue because it will define if there are functional parts that have to be done before others. This step should be done using as input the SSM, which contains useful information about dependencies between abstract services descriptions. The technique “Service Dependency Diagram” can be used to perform this step. Although SSM contains information about dependencies (required services), a dependencies diagram can be completed with this technique. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/P></sectionDescription>
