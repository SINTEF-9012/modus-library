  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a project is initiated there is no comprehensive, time-consuming effort to write down all foreseeable tasks or&#xD;
    requirements. Typically, a project writes down everything obvious, which is almost always more than enough for a first&#xD;
    sprint. The Product Backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/tasks/sprint_planning_meeting_9F0B8F28.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_4gCKAOF9Edyp34pwdTOSVQ&quot;>Sprint Planning Meeting&lt;/a> the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/roles/product_owner_10E7BD3.html&quot; guid=&quot;_QcnRMOF5Edyp34pwdTOSVQ&quot;>Product&#xD;
    Owner&lt;/a> prioritizes the items in the Product Backlog and describes them to the team. The team then determines which&#xD;
    items they can complete during the coming Sprint. The team then moves items from the Product Backlog to the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.scrum.base-sintef/workproducts/sprint_backlog_7A5B8A37.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Q5Ki8OF8Edyp34pwdTOSVQ&quot;>Sprint Backlog&lt;/a>. In doing they expand each Product Backlog item into one or more&#xD;
    Sprint Backlog tasks so they can more effectively share work during the Sprint. Conceptually, the team starts at the&#xD;
    top of the prioritized Product Backlog list and draws a line after the lowest of the high priority items they feel they&#xD;
    can complete. In practice it is not unusual to see a team select, for example, the top five items and then two items&#xD;
    from lower on the list but that are associated with the initial five.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product backlog items can be technical tasks (&quot;Refactor the Login class to throw an exception&quot;) or more user-centric&#xD;
    (&quot;Allow undo on the setup screen&quot;). A very interesting prospect is expressing Scrum backlog items in the form of&#xD;
    Extreme Programming's User Stories.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog can be maintained in an Excel spreadsheet. An example from a real project is shown below. This&#xD;
    Excel spreadsheet shows each product backlog item assigned a general priority (Very High, High, etc.) by the Product&#xD;
    Owner. Estimates have been developed by the developers but it is understood that they are very imprecise and are useful&#xD;
    only for rough assignments of tasks into the various sprints.&#xD;
