  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On each day of a sprint, the team holds daily meetings (“the daily scrum”). Meetings are typically held in the same&#xD;
    location and at the same time each day. Ideally the daily scrums are held in the morning as they help set the context&#xD;
    for the coming day's work.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    All team members are required to attend the daily scrum. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson, or&#xD;
    a developer from another project) is allowed to attend but is there only to listen. This makes the daily scrums an&#xD;
    excellent way for a Scrum team to disseminate status information--if you're interested in hearing where things are at,&#xD;
    attend that day's meeting.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The daily scrum is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline&#xD;
    and usually dealt with by the relevant sub-group immediately after the daily scrum. During the daily scrum each team&#xD;
    member provides answers to the following three questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What did you do yesterday?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will you do today?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any impediments in your way?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today the team gains an excellent&#xD;
    understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum is not a status update meeting in which&#xD;
    a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make&#xD;
    commitments to each other. If a programmer stands up and says &quot;Today I will finish the data storage module&quot; everyone&#xD;
    knows that in tomorrow's meeting he will say whether or not he did finish. This has the wonderful effect of helping a&#xD;
    team realize the significance of these commitments and that their commitments are to each other, not to some far-off&#xD;
    customer or salesman.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical&#xD;
    issues) he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is an old joke in which a chicken and a pig are talking and the chicken says, &quot;Let's start a restaurant.&quot; The pig&#xD;
    replies, &quot;Good idea, but what should we call it?&quot; &quot;How about 'Ham and Eggs'&quot; says the chicken. &quot;No thanks,&quot; says the&#xD;
    pig, &quot;I'd be committed, you'd only be involved.&quot; The joke is meant to point out the difference between those who are&#xD;
    committed on a project and those who are only involved. Scrum affords special status to those who are committed and&#xD;
    many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any impediments that are raised become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible. Typical&#xD;
    impediments are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        My ____ broke and I need a new one today.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        I need help debugging a problem with ______.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        I'm struggling to learn ______ and would like to pair with someone on it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        I can't get the ____ group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The department VP has asked me to work on something else &quot;for a day or two.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
