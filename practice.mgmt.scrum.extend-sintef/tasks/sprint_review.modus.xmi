  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of each sprint a sprint review meeting is held. During this meeting the Scrum team shows what they&#xD;
    accomplished during the sprint. Typically this takes the form of a demo of the new features.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Participants in the sprint review typically include the Product Owner, the Scrum team, the ScrumMaster, management,&#xD;
    customers, and engineers from other projects.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    During the sprint review the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the Sprint planning meeting.&#xD;
    Ideally the team has completed each product backlog item brought into the sprint, but it is more important that they&#xD;
    achieve the overall goal of the sprint.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The sprint review meeting is intentionally kept very informal, typically with rules forbidding the use of PowerPoint&#xD;
    slides and allowing no more than two hours of preparation time for the meeting. A sprint review meeting should not&#xD;
    become a distraction or significant detour for the team; rather, it should be a natural result of the sprint.&#xD;
