    The Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) presents a process management tool platform and conceptual framework for authoring,&#xD;
    tailoring and deploying development processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    First release version 1.0 planned for September 2006&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Goals&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Process Framework Project has two goals:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To provide an extensible framework and exemplary tools for software process engineering - method and process&#xD;
        authoring, library management, configuring and publishing a process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To provide exemplary and extensible process content for a range of software development and management processes&#xD;
        supporting iterative, agile, and incremental development, and applicable to a broad set of development platforms&#xD;
        and applications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;a id=&quot;N1006D&quot; name=&quot;N1006D&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;Process+framework&quot; name=&quot;Process+framework&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Process framework&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.modelbased.net/mdi/method/technologies_files/method_process_framework.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically the word framework is used in the context of an environment one can use to define partial or complete&#xD;
    solutions for a particular problem domain. In defining these solutions reusable structures are used as starting points&#xD;
    or building blocks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process framework is a similar thing. It defines reusable method content, processes, building blocks and tools that&#xD;
    can be utilized to define specific processes and methods. (EPF Composer ships with one or more of these process&#xD;
    frameworks, to help the developer in the process, but as well is equiped with the ability to create a completely new&#xD;
    method from scratch)th&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Method content is primarily expressed using work producs, roles, tasks and guidance. Roles are identified in the&#xD;
    development process and these represent a set of skills. Competencies and responsabilities in the development team.&#xD;
    These roles are responsible for specific work products and for creating or modifying these work products, roles are&#xD;
    assigned to perform tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to roles, tasks and work products EPF supports the addition of guidances in the form of whitepapers,&#xD;
    concept description, guidelines, examples etc. Guidence is also present in the process representation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the representation of the process the main concept is the activity which can be nested to define breakdown&#xD;
    structures and they can relate to each other to form work flows. Activities in EPF define to kind of processes:&#xD;
    delivery processes and capability patterns.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivery processes represent a complete and integrated processs templete for performing one specific type of project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capability patterns are processes that express process knowledge for a key area of interest such as disipline or a best&#xD;
    practice. They can be directly used by process practitioners to guide their work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;a id=&quot;N10083&quot; name=&quot;N10083&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;EPF+Composer&quot; name=&quot;EPF+Composer&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    EPF Composer&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EPF Composer is a tool platform for process engineers, project leads, project and program managers who are responsible&#xD;
    for mainteining and implementing processes for development organizations or individual projects&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Aims to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        provide for development practitioners a knowledge base of intelectual capital that allows them to browse, manage&#xD;
        and deploy content.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        provide process engineering capabilities by supporting processe engineers and project managers in selecting,&#xD;
        tailoring, and rapidly assembling processes for their concrete development process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EPF Composer allows you to take method content and to structure it in one specific way using a predefined schema. This&#xD;
    schema is an evolution of the SPEM 1.1 OMG specification, which is currently being evaluated to become the 2.0 version&#xD;
    of this specification. This method contents can overcome the limits of software engineering covering other design and&#xD;
    disiplines such as bussiness transformations, sales cycles and so on. In EMF Composer they are represented as a&#xD;
    construct of roles defining development skills and responsabilities for work products. Method contents can be found in&#xD;
    books or publications on software engineering methods, best practices, standards, regulations or even homegrown&#xD;
    methods.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In EMF Composer processes are typically expressed as workflows or breakdown structures. This framework provides&#xD;
    oportunities that aims at supporting processes based on many different development approaches, development culture and&#xD;
    development process representation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Key concepts&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Redesigned tools for authoring, configuring, viewing, and publishing development processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Just-in-time generation of publication previews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Management of method content using simple form-based user interfaces.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Intuitive rich text editors for content description&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Processes with: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                breakdown structure editors&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                workflow diagrams&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support for many alternative lifecycle models.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improved reuse and extensibility capabilities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reusable dynamically-linked process patterns&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
