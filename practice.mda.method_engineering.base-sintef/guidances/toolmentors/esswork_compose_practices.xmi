  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    EssWork supports composing practices into processes and to manage and maintain the resulting processes. Processes can&#xD;
    be managed and maintained as follows in the web client Explorer:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Create a Process&lt;/em>; right click on the Processes node and select Create Process from the popup menu. A&#xD;
        dialogue for creating a process is presented. In the dialog, the Title, Introduction and Copyright of the process&#xD;
        are specified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Modify Process&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Modify Process from the popup menu. A&#xD;
        dialogue for modifying a process is presented. In the dialogue, the Title, Introduction and Copyright of the&#xD;
        process can be changed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Delete Process&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Delete Process from the popup menu. The&#xD;
        process will be removed from the work space after the confirmation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Compose Practices&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Compose &lt;em>Practices&lt;/em> from the&#xD;
        popup menu. A dialogue for composing practices into the process is presented. In the dialogue, practices can be&#xD;
        selected to be composed into or to be removed from the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Import a Process&lt;/em>; right click on the Processes node and select Import Process from the popup menu. A&#xD;
        process packaged in a zip file (usually as the result from an export operation) can be imported to the current&#xD;
        EssWork work space.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Export a Process&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Export Process from the popup menu. In&#xD;
        the exporting mode dialog, the process can be exported as a zip file or directly exported to another work space.&#xD;
        The option of exporting to another work space means copying processes from one work space to another directly. The&#xD;
        option of exporting as a zip file means creating a zip file that (later) can be imported to another work space.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Save as HTML&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Save as HTML from the popup menu. The&#xD;
        result is a HTML site representing the process that can be deployed to a project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Validate the Process&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Validate Process from the popup&#xD;
        menu. This will present a table overview of the validation report. After expanded the table, clicking on the&#xD;
        element title in the table will navigate to the individual elementâ€™s detailed validation report. The report is&#xD;
        categorized as according to Dependency Errors, Closure Errors, Compose-ability Errors and Completeness Errors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>View Alpha-Activity Cross Reference&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select View Alpha-Activity&#xD;
        Cross Reference from the popup menu. The resulting view provides one table for each alpha in the process, and shows&#xD;
        how the states of the alpha are achieved by activities. This is a static view showing the impact of task generation&#xD;
        as applied in the work packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Save Alpha-Activity Cross Reference&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Save Alpha-Activity&#xD;
        Cross Reference from the popup menu. This function will save the cross reference on XML format.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;em>Refresh&lt;/em>; right click on a specific process node and select Refresh from the popup menu. This will read and&#xD;
        view the latest versions of the process from the file system. This is relevant if the process have been changed or&#xD;
        updated in the file system but external to the EssWork web client, for example as a result of EssWork Word&#xD;
        Authoring Add-In uploading.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
