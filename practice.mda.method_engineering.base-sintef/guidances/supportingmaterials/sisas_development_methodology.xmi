    The SiSaS Development Methodology contains an EPF library of practices and an associated SiSaS Methodology website. The&#xD;
    SiSaS practices follows the essential structure defined by the MODUS Methodology Framework and introduces a rich set of&#xD;
    practices that have been developed in SiSaS by adopting EUP, Scrum, COMET-S and refining method results from EU&#xD;
    projects such as SHAPE.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The practices have been categorized as architecture, business, management (mgmt), platform and requirements practices.&#xD;
    In addition we have introduced the categories framework and innovation.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    A first release of all the SiSaS practices have been released and made available on the SiSaS methodology website at &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://sisas.modelbased.net&quot;>http://sisas.modelbased.net&lt;/a>. In this first release we focused on developing an&#xD;
    initial version of the practices to correspond with the course material. In the next phase of the project we will&#xD;
    complete the practices by adding better and more detailed guidelines.&#xD;
