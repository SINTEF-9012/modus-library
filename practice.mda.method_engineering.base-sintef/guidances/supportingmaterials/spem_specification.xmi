    Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM)&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is a metamodel and a UML profile to describe software engineering&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identifies the typical concepts of a process (process, phase, role, model, etc.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defines them using UML extensions (stereotypes applied to various elements: class, use cases, operations, etc.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assigns a characteristic icon to each new item.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The SPEM representation of a process is based upon the collaboration between active entities called ProcessRoles that&#xD;
    execute tasks called Activities on concrete entities called WorkProducts. SPEM defines notational icons or graphical&#xD;
    representation for SPEM concepts that are represented by UML stereotypes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;a id=&quot;N10023&quot; name=&quot;N10023&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;Modelling+constructs&quot; name=&quot;Modelling+constructs&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Modelling constructs&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The concepts defined in SPEM are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>WorkDefinition:&lt;/strong> It’s a kind of operation that describes the work performed in the process. Its&#xD;
        main subclass is Activity, but phase, iteration and lifecycle are also subclasses of WorkDefinition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activity:&lt;/strong> It’s the main subclass of WorkDefinition. An activity describes any part of work&#xD;
        executed or assisted by a ProcessRole like tasks, operations and actions. An activity may consist of atomic&#xD;
        elements called steps.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Process:&lt;/strong> A Process is a ProcessComponent intended to stand alone as a complete, end-to-end&#xD;
        process. It is distinguished from normal process components by the fact that it is not intended to be composed with&#xD;
        other components.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Document:&lt;/strong> It is a specialization of a WorkProduct that contains information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Guidance:&lt;/strong> Indirect support to actual software developers or managers working with a&#xD;
        process-centred software engineering environment through interpretation of an instantiated process model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Phase:&lt;/strong> A phase is a specialization of WorkDefinition such that its precondition defines the phase&#xD;
        entry criteria and its goal (often called a “milestone”) defines the phase exit criteria. Phases can be sequential&#xD;
        or can run in parallel.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>ProcessPackage:&lt;/strong> It is a special notation for packages in a SPEM context. A package is a cohesive&#xD;
        collection of work products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>ProcessPerformer:&lt;/strong> The process performer is the performer of higher-level aggregate WorkDefinitions&#xD;
        that cannot be associated with individual ProcessRoles. ProcessPerformer represents abstractly the “whole process”&#xD;
        or one of its components, and is used to own WorkDefinitions that do not have a more specific owner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>ProcessRole:&lt;/strong> The process role is the performer of activities. Also defines responsibilities over&#xD;
        specific WorkProducts, and defines the roles that perform and assist in specific activities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>UMLModel:&lt;/strong> It is a specialization of a WorkProduct that allows to model static, dynamic and&#xD;
        behavioural view of process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>WorkProduct:&lt;/strong> A work product or artefact is anything produced, consumed, or modified by a process.&#xD;
        It may be a piece of information, a document, a model, source code, a service provided to an end user and so on. A&#xD;
        WorkProduct describes one class of work product produced in a process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
