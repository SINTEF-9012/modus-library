    The purpose of the Context Statement is to define the scope of a business model and to position it in its context. This&#xD;
    may be done by identifying relationships to some other business models or by developing and getting agreement to a more&#xD;
    informal representation of the target business being modelled in its environment. This informal representation takes&#xD;
    the form of a domain picture aiming to give an overall understanding of the domain. It focuses on describing&#xD;
    stakeholders and their relationships and identifies stakeholders concerns. It typically covers key value-chains and&#xD;
    information flows. The emphasis is on the process of building it, agreeing it with subject matter experts and thereby&#xD;
    understanding the context. Thus, it may not be maintained in subsequent phases of the development of the Product.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step in developing any business model is to identify and record the names of all people who will have an&#xD;
    interest in having the Product developed or in its use, the business stakeholders, together with the nature of their&#xD;
    interest. This list may change over time but should always include representatives of all having an interest in the&#xD;
    Product in any way. The following are examples of business stakeholders who should be involved:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        people who will authorise funding for development of the Product;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        people who are responsible for design and maintenance of the business processes to be supported by the Product;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        people who will use the Product;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        people who will be responsible for the acceptance of the Product;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        people who will be responsible for managing operation of the Product&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The approach taken to developing a Context Statement depends on the existence or not of some higher level business&#xD;
    model of which the new model forms a part. Whatever the approach, however, the process consists of fact finding,&#xD;
    discussion and agreement with all business stakeholders, using one or more small workshops or interviews followed by&#xD;
    one or more feed-back sessions at which draft models are presented and walked through.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is most important not to get bogged down in detail at this stage, and therefore it may be that the workshops or&#xD;
    interviews are very short, and they may, where the Context Statement can be agreed, be combined with the workshops and&#xD;
    interviews used to develop the later business modelling work products. However, it is equally important that the full&#xD;
    scope (and limitations to scope) of the project is clearly understood, and that all stakeholders agree to this. In all&#xD;
    events, progression to subsequent business modelling work products should not commence until this agreement is reached,&#xD;
    even if only informally.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where no higher level model exists, an informal representation of the context of the Component to be developed may be&#xD;
    prepared. This may use Use Case modelling techniques as described under Requirements Modelling. Alternatively the&#xD;
    concepts of a “Rich Picture” may be used. This is a highly informal “modelling” technique, and subtle nuances of&#xD;
    meaning should be avoided or disregarded. The key point is the understanding of the business context that all share at&#xD;
    the end of the exercise, to which end it may only be said about the resultant model that the business context is&#xD;
    “something like this”. Informality and lack of rigour at this stage does not matter, as it will be added in the other&#xD;
    business modelling work products. Thus, where a Rich Picture is used for this Work Product, it should be remembered&#xD;
    that it will be superseded by the more formal models that are later developed. A Rich Picture should not form any part&#xD;
    of a delivered Product’s formal documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where a higher level model exists, then the Context Statement would be prepared through a process of examination of the&#xD;
    higher level model in order to identify those items that have any impact on the business model being produced. Thus it&#xD;
    would identify, for further detailing:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        all roles that appear in, or interact with roles that appear in, the business model being produced;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        all actors associated with those roles;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        all resources associated with those roles&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
