    The purpose of the BMM is to agree with the business stakeholders the business goals that will be met by implementing&#xD;
    the service-oriented architecture, so that a set of required high level business processes can be identified for&#xD;
    further analysis. BMM provides a scheme or structure for developing, communicating, and managing business plans in an&#xD;
    organized manner. In particular, the BMM supports the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            It identifies factors that motivate the establishment of business plans.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            It identifies and defines the elements of business plans.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            It indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Among these elements you find business policies and business rule that provide governance for and guidance to the&#xD;
    business. Once produced and agreed, the BMM serves as a reference that ensures that a full assessment may be made of&#xD;
    all the business implications of any proposed changes to the service-oriented architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The specification of the goals and company’s motivations are defined in a business goals diagram which allow you to&#xD;
    define goals and objectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Goal:&lt;/strong> A statement about a state or condition of the enterprise to be brought about or sustained&#xD;
        through appropriate Means (i.e., Offerings expressed as Service Contracts).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Objective:&lt;/strong> An Objective is a statement of an attainable, time-targeted, and measurable target that&#xD;
        the enterprise seeks to meet in order to achieve its Goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals are discovered by a process of workshops and interviews involving relevant stakeholders. The BMM&#xD;
    describes a loose hierarchy of goals of the business within the particular area of concern, from the goals of a&#xD;
    business stakeholder in developing a product to the business goals met by the product or its users. Goals may be&#xD;
    thought of as high level statements of the things that have to happen in a business, each expressed as an outcome, but&#xD;
    without specifying the ”how”. As goal analysis proceeds, the analyst describes an enabling behaviour as the means by&#xD;
    which a higher level outcome is to be achieved. Initially this is done through a brain-storming process. This results&#xD;
    in a list of enabling behaviours that is further refined and consolidated into a set of enabling behaviours that&#xD;
    supports all the business goals. This is the starting point for business process modelling in a BPMN tool.&#xD;
