    Service Journey Map&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the following we describe the NEFFICS adaptation of techniques and practices for Customer Journey Maps (CJMs) that&#xD;
    we have used as a basis for what we call Service Journey Maps (SJMs). A main focus in CJM techniques is on the customer&#xD;
    experiences. In the spirit of the dual service consumer (customer)/service provider relationship during service&#xD;
    co-creation, we have decided to call this Service Journey Map (SJM), rather than Customer Journey Map (CJM) – to&#xD;
    emphasise that both the customer and the provider is involved in the journey together – and that there is a two-way&#xD;
    value exchange in various touch-points. The advantage of this is to get a description of the service process which&#xD;
    focuses on the service interactions, rather than on the flow of tasks and information and control, as in a BPMN model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Foundations for Service and Customer Journey Maps&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Customer Journey Mapping is one of the main techniques within the field and community of service design and service&#xD;
    innovation [Schneider and Stickdorn 2011]. This part gives a brief introduction of the concepts related to CJM.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here follows a description of the most important service journey concepts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>1. Customer Experience:&lt;/strong> Customer experience (CX) is the sum of all experiences a customer has with&#xD;
        a supplier of goods or services, over the duration of their relationship with that supplier. From awareness,&#xD;
        discovery, attraction, interaction, purchase, use, cultivation and advocacy, it can also be used to mean an&#xD;
        individual experience over one transaction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>2. Touch-point:&lt;/strong> Every service is made of episodes or encounters where the production of the&#xD;
        service and the interactions between a customer and service provider happen. These episodes, which together&#xD;
        constitute the service entity, are called touch-points. Another explanation is that touch-point is a point&#xD;
        (what/who) that is touched via any channel (when/where/how) for a purpose (why). That said it is every point of&#xD;
        interaction, internal and external, seen and unseen.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>3. Customer Journey:&lt;/strong> Services are processes that happen over time, and this process includes&#xD;
        several service touch-points. When all service touch-point are connected the Customer Journey is formed. The&#xD;
        customer journey is formed both by the service provider's explicit action as well as by the customer's choices.&#xD;
        Figure 9 illustrates an example of a Customer Journey of ordering movie ticket.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>4. Service channel:&lt;/strong> Customer Channels are environments, spaces and places where the visible part&#xD;
        of the service production happens. Channels can be physical (e.g. a phone service). Often services are multichannel&#xD;
        customer experience, which means that they are produced through many different media. Customer channels are the&#xD;
        medium between customer and service provider. Each customer constructs his/her own unique Customer Journey since&#xD;
        people behave and act differently and because the service provider usually offers customers optional ways and&#xD;
        channels to consume a certain service. For example, flight tickets can be booked via the Internet or a travel&#xD;
        agency, and the customer can choose to travel to the airport in his own car or by taxi.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/service_channels.png&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 10: Service channels&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>5. Service Journey Mapping:&lt;/strong> Service (or Customer) Journey Mapping is a method of visually&#xD;
        representing the actual and everyday user experience of a service. Mapping journeys is one of the simplest and most&#xD;
        useful approaches to understand services, gaps in service, and to identify and design opportunities for improvement&#xD;
        and innovation. The mapping, representation and analysis of a journey, an experience over time, which has many&#xD;
        functions and can be applied to service design and innovation at various stages. A Customer Journey Map is built up&#xD;
        layer by layer. We start 'above water', with the customer and slowly dive deeper and deeper into the organizational&#xD;
        structures and context. The technique can be used with customers or management, employees and other stakeholder or,&#xD;
        even better, in a mix.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Service Journey Map metamodel and notation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/service_journey_map_metamodel.png&quot; width=&quot;561&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 11: Service (Customer) Journey Map (SJM) metamodel&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The SJM metamodel reflects the main elements in a process of interactions between a service user and a service&#xD;
    provider.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Service/(Customer) Journey Model:&lt;/strong> The aggregate of the main elements in the Service Journey, like&#xD;
        the journey itself with touch-points and associated actors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Journey:&lt;/strong> The set of touch-points that it can distinguish between expected journey and actual&#xD;
        journey as experienced by a service user (customer) and a service provider. A journey can be described as the&#xD;
        expected/planned journey by the service provider, which might be different from the actual journey as experienced&#xD;
        by the service user/customer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Touch-point:&lt;/strong> The interaction points between service provider and service user, taking place across&#xD;
        a channel (e.g., Web, e-mail, SMS, face-to-face, smartphone, etc.). Touch-points can be as expected or ad hoc.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actor:&lt;/strong> Includes both service customer(s) and service provider(s) and potentially third parties.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Channel:&lt;/strong> Includes the different physical means of having a service interaction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 12: Service Journey Map notation&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The elements of the SJM metamodel can be depicted in different ways, both with a graphical and lexical syntax. The&#xD;
    initial notation approach is following ideas from existing techniques for Customer Journey Mapping notations.&#xD;
