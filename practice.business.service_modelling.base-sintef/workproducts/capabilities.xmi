  <mainDescription>Capabilities identify or specify a cohesive set of functions or resources that a service provided by one or more&#xD;
participants might offer. Capabilities can be used by themselves or in conjunction with participants to represent general&#xD;
functionality or abilities that a participant must have. Capabilities are used to identify needed services, and to organize&#xD;
them into catalogues in order to communicate the needs and capabilities of a service area, whether that be business or&#xD;
technology focused, prior to allocating those services to particular participants. Capabilities can have usage dependencies&#xD;
on other capabilities to show how these capabilities are related. Capabilities can also be organized into architectural&#xD;
layers to support separation of concern within the resulting service architecture.</mainDescription>
