MODUS PRACTICE LIBRARY
=====

The MODUS Practice Library contains practices defined in the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) that we

* use as a baseline or extend when we are developing Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) practices; or 
* use as a baseline for selecting, composing and tailoring a custom methodology.
