    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and&#xD;
    the architecture of the project gets its basic form. The key domain analysis for the elaboration is system&#xD;
    architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This phase must pass the Lifecycle Architecture Milestone by the following criteria:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A use-case model in which the use-cases and the actors have been identified and most of the use-case descriptions&#xD;
        are developed. The use-case model should be 80% complete.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of the software architecture in a software system development process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An executable architecture that realizes architecturally significant use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business case and risk list which are revised.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A development plan for the overall project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prototypes that demonstrably mitigate each identified technical risk.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project cannot pass this milestone, there is still time for it to be canceled or redesigned. After leaving this&#xD;
    phase, the project transitions into a high-risk operation where changes are much more difficult and detrimental when&#xD;
    made.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <purpose>The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase.</purpose>

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this phase, the main focus goes to the development of components and other features of the system being designed.&#xD;
    This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place. In larger projects, several construction iterations may be&#xD;
    developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments that produce demonstrable prototypes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This phase produces the first external release of the software. Its conclusion is marked by the Initial Operational&#xD;
    Capability Milestone.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition,&#xD;
    etc), and financial forecast is established. To complement the business case, a basic use case model, project plan,&#xD;
    initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features are&#xD;
    generated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The phase must pass the&amp;nbsp;Lifecycle Objective Milestone by the following criteria:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stakeholder concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establishing a baseline by which to compare actual expenditures versus planned expenditures.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project does not pass this milestone&amp;nbsp;it can either be cancelled or it can repeat this phase after being&#xD;
    redesigned to better meet the criteria.&#xD;

    The activities of this phase include training of the end users and maintainers and beta testing of the system to&#xD;
    validate it against the end users' expectations. The product is also checked against the quality level set in the&#xD;
    Inception phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If all objectives are met, the Product Release Milestone is reached and the development cycle ends.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <purpose>The primary objective is to 'transition' the system from the development into production, making it available to and&#xD;
understood by the end user.</purpose>

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This process will differ from organization to organization and perhaps even from system to system, but the fundamental&#xD;
    goal remains the same: keep the system running and help users to use it. Shrink-wrapped software, for example, will not&#xD;
    require operational support but will typically require a help desk to assist users. Organizations that implement&#xD;
    systems for internal use will usually require an operational staff to run and monitor systems. The Production phase,&#xD;
    like the rest of the EUP, requires each organization to tailor it to meet their specific needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Production phase ends when the release of a system has been slated for retirement or when support for that release&#xD;
    has ended. The latter may occur immediately upon the release of a newer version, some time after the release of a newer&#xD;
    version, or simply on a date that the business has decided to end support. The Release Retirement milestone, described&#xD;
    in detail in a later section, is the final approval for a release to exit the production phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>This phase typically has one iteration because it applies to the operational lifetime of a single release of your&#xD;
software. There may be multiple iterations, however, if you defined multiple levels of support that your software will have&#xD;
over time.</mainDescription>
    <purpose>The goal of the Production phase is to keep systems useful and productive after they have been deployed to the user&#xD;
community.</purpose>

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    System releases are removed from production for several reasons, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The system is being complete replaced. It is not uncommon to see homegrown systems for human resource functions&#xD;
        being replaced by COTS systems such as SAP (www.sap.com) or Oracle Financials (www.oracle.com).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The release is no longer to be supported. Sometimes organizations will have several releases in production at the&#xD;
        same time, and over time older releases are dropped.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The system no longer needed to support the current business model. A organization may explore a new business area&#xD;
        by developing new systems only to discover that it is not cost effective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The system is redundant. Organizations that grow by mergers and/or acquisitions often end up with redundant systems&#xD;
        as they consolidate their operations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The system has become obsolete.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most cases, the retirement of older releases is a handled during the deployment of a newer version of the system and&#xD;
    is a relatively simple exercise. Typically, the deployment of the new release includes steps to remove the previous&#xD;
    release. There are times, however, when you do not retire a release simply because you deploy a newer version. This may&#xD;
    happen if you can not require users to migrate to the new release or if you must maintain an older system for backward&#xD;
    compatibility.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The final retirement of a system can be a different matter. In this case you cannot rely on a newer version of your&#xD;
    system being available to supply the functionality which you are retiring. Instead this functionality, and the data&#xD;
    which supports it, is either implemented by another system (often in a very different manner to the end user) or is&#xD;
    completely removed. The implication is that you may have significant rework to do in order to update the other systems&#xD;
    which interface to this functionality. Final retirement of a system is typically executed in parallel with the&#xD;
    implementation of other system(s) which are replacing it, such as when an internally-developed system is replaced by a&#xD;
    commercial off the shelf (COTS) solution. In these situations the two efforts must be closely coordinated and may even&#xD;
    be staffed by the same personnel.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of this phase is the removal of a system release from production, and occasionally even the complete system&#xD;
    itself, an activity also known as system decommissioning or system sunsetting. Retirement of systems is a serious issue&#xD;
    faced by many organizations today as legacy systems are removed and replaced by new systems. You must strive to&#xD;
    complete this effort with minimal impact to business operations.&#xD;
