    The Change Management discipline in RUP deals with three specific areas: configuration management, change request&#xD;
    management, and Status and measurement management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Configuration management: Configuration management is responsible for the systematic structuring of the products.&#xD;
        Artifacts such as documents and models need to be under version control and these changes must be visible. It also&#xD;
        keeps track of dependencies between artifacts so all related articles are updated when changes are made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Change request management: During the system development process many artifacts with several versions exist. CRM&#xD;
        keeps track of the proposals for change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Status and measurement management: Change requests have states such as new, logged, approved, assigned and&#xD;
        complete. A change request also has attributes such as root cause, or nature (like defect and enhancement),&#xD;
        priority etc. These states and attributes are stored in database so useful reports about the progress of the&#xD;
        project can be produced. Rational also has a product to maintain change requests called ClearQuest. This activity&#xD;
        has procedures to be followed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
