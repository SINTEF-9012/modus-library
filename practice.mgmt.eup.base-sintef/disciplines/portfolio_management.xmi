  <mainDescription>A&amp;nbsp;software portfolio is a collection of IT projects, both proposed and in progress, as well as the deployed systems&#xD;
within your organization. Your IT portfolio should be a diversified mix of high-risk/high-reward and low-risk/low-reward&#xD;
elements, just like your personal investment portfolio, all leading to the creation of systems to support a strategic&#xD;
business goal.&amp;nbsp;You do this by ensuring that all projects are visible, planned for, and aligned to the goals of the&#xD;
business. Successful IT departments look beyond the needs of a single system; studies have shown that organizations that&#xD;
manage their IT investments most successfully generate as much as a 40% higher return than their competitors. It is&#xD;
critical to recognize that portfolio management must happen throughout the entire lifecycle of a system: from its inception&#xD;
and initial vision through the end of retirement.&amp;nbsp;</mainDescription>
