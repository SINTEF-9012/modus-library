  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations are becoming more dependent on IT systems, making it imperative that information system engineers know&#xD;
    how the applications they are developing fit into the organization. Businesses invest in IT when they understand the&#xD;
    competitive advantage and value added by the technology. The aim of business modeling is to first establish a better&#xD;
    understanding and communication channel between business engineering and software engineering. Understanding the&#xD;
    business means that software engineers must understand the structure and the dynamics of the target organization (the&#xD;
    client), the current problems in the organization and possible improvements. They must also ensure a common&#xD;
    understanding of the target organization between customers, end users and developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business modeling explains how to describe a vision of the organization in which the system will be deployed and how to&#xD;
    then use this vision as a basis to outline the process, roles and responsibilities.&#xD;
