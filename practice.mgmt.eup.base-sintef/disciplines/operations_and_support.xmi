  <mainDescription>The primary goal of the Operations and Support discipline is to operate and support your software in a production&#xD;
environment. The focus of operations is to ensure that software is running properly, that the network is available and&#xD;
monitored, and that the appropriate data is backed up and restored as needed. Disaster plans are created, and in the event&#xD;
a disaster occurs, they are executed to restore primary systems. The focus of support is to assist end users by answering&#xD;
their questions, analyzing the problems that they are encountering with production systems, recording requests for new&#xD;
functionality, and making and applying fixes. Furthermore, an important message of this discipline is that in order for it&#xD;
to succeed your organization must be as agile as possible: it is possible for enterprise-level professionals (including&#xD;
operations and support staff) to work in an agile manner, but they must choose to do so and be allowed to do so.</mainDescription>
