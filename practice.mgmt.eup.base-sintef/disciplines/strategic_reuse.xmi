    Reusability is one of the &quot;holy grails&quot; of the information technology (IT) industry, one that is seldom achieved. Many&#xD;
    organizations fail at reuse because they don't understand its scope; reuse between projects is where you get your&#xD;
    payback, not reuse within a single project. Many organizations prematurely give up on reuse when they don't see&#xD;
    positive returns on their first few projects or even on their very first one. Strategic reuse is a long-term endeavor&#xD;
    that has strategic returns instead of tactical ones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An asset is a project artifact that is retained at the end of a project. A robust asset is well documented, generalized&#xD;
    beyond the needs of a single project, thoroughly tested, and ideally has several examples to show how to work with it.&#xD;
    Robust assets are much more likely to be reused than items without these characteristics. A reusable asset is a robust&#xD;
    asset that has been used on three separate projects by three separate project teams (at a minimum). You can claim that&#xD;
    something is reusable, but it isn't truly reusable until it's actually been reused; reusability is in the eye of the&#xD;
    reuser, not in the eye of the creator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reuse is often described as not &quot;reinventing the wheel,&quot; and the first step for succeeding at reuse is to understand&#xD;
    that you have more than one option at your disposal. You can reuse source code, components, development artifacts,&#xD;
    patterns, and templates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key component to reuse is open communication within your organization: this is usually the major point of failure in&#xD;
    implementing any reuse program in our experience.&#xD;
