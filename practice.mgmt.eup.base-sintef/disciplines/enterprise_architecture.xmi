  <mainDescription>An effective enterprise architecture promotes consistency across your organization's systems by guiding development teams&#xD;
towards using a common set of proven approaches to, and even product-lines of, application architecture. This enables both&#xD;
reuse and system integration through common mechanisms and compatible semantics across systems. Enterprise architects are&#xD;
concerned with how their work impacts multiple systems for both the present, in the form of &quot;as is&quot; models, and for the&#xD;
future, in the form of &quot;to be&quot; models. They look further than the needs of a single application and assess architectural&#xD;
impact on the entire enterprise, looking beyond the current information technology (IT) needs and laying the foundation for&#xD;
future efforts. &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Enterprise architects are responsible for formulating, proving, and then supporting the enterprise architecture. The&#xD;
architecture itself is built out through the efforts of your enterprise administrators who are responsible for your data,&#xD;
security, network, and hardware infrastructures. Your enterprise architecture will also be built out by application project&#xD;
teams. Your enterprise architects should not only support these build out efforts they should also be actively involved in&#xD;
them.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The main difference between enterprise and application architecture is one of scope. Whereas an application architect on a&#xD;
development project identifies architectural solutions for a system, an enterprise architect defines architectural&#xD;
solutions, frameworks, patterns, and reference architectures for use across multiple systems within the organization.&#xD;
Application architects guide the team of application designers and implementers in their efforts of understanding and&#xD;
applying the application architecture; enterprise architects guide application architects in their understanding and&#xD;
applying of the enterprise architecture. Just as application architects take a broader yet generally shallower view than&#xD;
the designers and implementers of a system, enterprise architects take a broader and generally shallower view than&#xD;
application architects. Although the enterprise architect establishes the architecture for your organization, the actual&#xD;
implementation of it is done by your application development teams and by enterprise administrators (who often build&#xD;
infrastructure in advance of systems being released).&lt;br />&#xD;
