  <mainDescription>The Project management discipline an project planning in the RUP occurs at two levels. There is a coarse-grained or Phase&#xD;
plan which describes the entire project, and a series of fine-grained or Iteration plans which describe the iterations.&#xD;
This discipline focuses mainly on the important aspects of an iterative development process: Risk management, Planning an&#xD;
iterative project, through the lifecycle and for a particular iteration, and Monitoring progress of an iterative project,&#xD;
metrics. However, this discipline of the RUP does not attempt to cover all aspects of project management.</mainDescription>
