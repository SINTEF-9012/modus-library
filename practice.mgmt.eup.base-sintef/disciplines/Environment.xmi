    The environment discipline focuses on the activities necessary to configure the process for a project. It describes the&#xD;
    activities required to develop the guidelines in support of a project. The purpose of the environment activities is to&#xD;
    provide the software development organization with the software development environment-both processes and tools-that&#xD;
    will support the development team. If the users of RUP do not understand that RUP is a process framework, they may&#xD;
    perceive it as a weighty and expensive process. However a key concept within RUP was that the RUP process could and&#xD;
    often should itself be refined. This was initially done manually, ie by writing a &quot;Development case&quot; document that&#xD;
    specified the refined process to be used. Later the IBM Rational Method Composer product was created to help make this&#xD;
    step simpler, so process engineers and project managers could more easily customize the RUP for their project needs.&#xD;
    Many of the later variants of RUP, including OpenUP/Basic, the lightweight and open source version of RUP, are now&#xD;
    presented as separate processes in their own right, and cater for different types and sizes of projects and trends and&#xD;
    technologies in software development. Historically, as the RUP is often customized for each project by a RUP process&#xD;
    expert, the project's overall success can be somewhat dependent on the abilities of this one person.&#xD;
