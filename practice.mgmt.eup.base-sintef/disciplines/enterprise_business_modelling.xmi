    The Enterprise Business Modeling discipline is important to the success of your IT organization for several reasons:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It helps to facilitate a common understanding of the business that your organization is engaged in. Although this&#xD;
        may seem superfluous to some, formally documenting the business that your organization engages in will lead to many&#xD;
        interesting conversations about how things should really work and, ultimately, to a shared understanding of exactly&#xD;
        what business you are in and how you execute your work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It helps to identify areas of your business that can be improved either through targeted automation or wide-scale&#xD;
        business process reengineering.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It helps to identify business areas that your organization doesn't yet address or that your organization is very&#xD;
        weak in.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides important information to project teams that can help them to delimit the scope of their project, in&#xD;
        particular helping them to identify how their effort fits into the overall business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;BodyNoIndent&quot;>&#xD;
    Development of the enterprise business model starts with a broad view of the entire business. This doesn't mean that&#xD;
    you'll model your entire business: for example, you may choose to ignore the accounting aspects of your organization&#xD;
    because it's stable, but it does mean that your model will go beyond the scope of a single project. Your goal should be&#xD;
    to capture the fundamentals of your business by working with your stakeholders in an all-encompassing yet shallow&#xD;
    model; you don't need much detail, but you do need breadth. You need to identify and prioritize areas of importance so&#xD;
    that they can be explored in detail by the business modeling efforts of individual project teams. Your enterprise&#xD;
    business model should define an accurate, high-level overview of the business and should contain information that is&#xD;
    relatively stable over time. For example, within a bank, the need to process retail banking transactions has existed&#xD;
    for centuries, yet the way in which this occurs has changed dramatically over time: the high-level need is stable,&#xD;
    whereas the details are very fluid.&amp;nbsp; Your enterprise business modeling efforts should explore a wide range of&#xD;
    issues, and as a result, your enterprise business model is actually composed of a collection of smaller artifacts, such&#xD;
    as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise business rules&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise business process model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise domain model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise mission statement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise vision&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Organization model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
