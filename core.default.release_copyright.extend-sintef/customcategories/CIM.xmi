  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A computation independent model is a view of a system from the computation independent viewpoint. A CIM does not show&#xD;
    details of the structure of systems. A CIM is sometimes called a domain model and a vocabulary that is familiar to the&#xD;
    practitioners of the domain in question is used in its specification. It is assumed that the primary user of the CIM,&#xD;
    the domain practitioner, is not knowledgeable about the models or artifacts used to realize the functionality for which&#xD;
    the requirements are articulated in the CIM. The CIM plays an important role in bridging the gap between those that&#xD;
    are&amp;nbsp;experts about the domain and its requirements on the one hand, and those that are experts of the design and&#xD;
    construction of the&lt;br />&#xD;
    artifacts that together satisfy the domain requirements, on the other.&#xD;
